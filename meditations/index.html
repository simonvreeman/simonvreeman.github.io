      <blockquote>
        <p>States will never be happy until rulers become philosophers or philosophers become rulers.</p>
        <cite><a href="#plato">Plato</a>, The Republic</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Marcus Aurelius is said to have been fond of quoting <a href="#plato">Plato’s</a> dictum, and those who have written about him have rarely been able to resist applying it to Marcus himself. And indeed, if we seek Plato’s philosopher-king in the flesh we could hardly do better than Marcus, the ruler of the Roman Empire for almost two decades and author of the immortal <em>Meditations</em>. Yet the title is one that Marcus himself would surely have rejected. He never thought of himself as a philosopher. He would have claimed to be, at best, a diligent student and a very imperfect practitioner of a philosophy developed by others. As for the imperial throne, that came almost by accident. When Marcus Annius Verus was born, in <abbr title="Anno Domini">A.D.</abbr> 121, bystanders might have predicted a distinguished career in the Senate or the imperial administration. They could hardly have guessed that he was destined for the imperial purple, or seen in their mind’s eye the lonely bronze horseman whose upraised hand greets us from the Capitoline hill in Rome across two thousand years.</p>
      <p>Marcus sprang from a distinguished enough family. The year of his birth coincided with his grandfather’s second tenure of the consulship, in theory Rome’s highest office, though now of largely ceremonial importance. And it was to be his grandfather who brought him up, for his father died when he was very young. Marcus makes reference in the <em>Meditations</em> to his father’s character as he remembered it or heard of it from others, but his knowledge must have been more from stories than from actual memories. Of the remainder of his childhood and his early adolescence we know little more than can be gleaned from the <em>Meditations</em>. The biography of him in the so-called <em>Historia Augusta</em> (a curious and unreliable work of the late fourth century probably based on a lost series of lives by the third-century biographer Marius Maximus) tells us that he was a serious child, but also that he loved boxing, wrestling, running and falconry, that he was a good ballplayer and that he loved to hunt. None of these are surprising occupations in an upper-class youth.</p>
      <p><a href="#book1">Book 1</a> of the <em>Meditations</em> offers glimpses of Marcus’s schooling, and we can fill out the picture by what is known of upper-class education generally at this period. His first instructors, like the unnamed teacher mentioned in <em>Meditations</em> <a href="#book1-5">1.5</a>, were probably slaves, from whom he would have mastered the rudiments of reading and writing. At a later stage he would have been handed over to private tutors to be introduced to literature, especially, no doubt, Vergil’s great epic, the <em>Aeneid</em>. But literature served only as a preparation for the real goal. This was rhetoric, the key to an active political career under the empire, as it had been under the Republic. Under the supervision of a trained rhetor, Marcus would have begun with short exercises before progressing to full-scale practice declamations in which he would have been asked to defend one side or another in imaginary law cases, or to advise a prominent historical figure at a turning point in his career. (Should Caesar cross the Rubicon? Should Alexander turn back at the Indus? Why or why not?)</p>
      <p>Such training was conducted in Greek as well as Latin. Since at least the beginning of the first century <abbr title="before Christ">B.C.</abbr> the Roman upper classes had been essentially bilingual, and Marcus’s spoken and written Greek would have been as fluent as the French of a nineteenth-century Russian aristocrat or the Chinese of a Heian Japanese courtier. Marcus would have read Homer’s <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> and the tragedies of Euripides side by side with the <em>Aeneid</em>, and studied the speeches of the great Athenian orator Demosthenes as intensively as those of the Roman statesman Cicero. It was Greek writers and artists who constituted the intellectual elite at the capital; when in later life the emperor conversed with his court physician, Galen, he would have done so in the latter’s native tongue. Above all, Greek remained overwhelmingly the language of philosophy. In the late Republic and early empire, writers like Lucretius, Cicero and Seneca had worked to create a philosophical literature in Latin, with notable success. But the great thinkers&mdash;<a href="#plato">Plato</a>, Aristotle, <a href="#theophrastus">Theophrastus</a>, Zeno, <a href="#chrysippus">Chrysippus</a>, <a href="#epicurus">Epicurus</a>, etc.&mdash;had all been Greeks. Serious philosophical investigation required a familiarity with the language they wrote in and the terminology they developed. That Marcus composed his own <em>Meditations</em> in Greek is natural enough.</p>
      <p>In 137, when Marcus was sixteen, a crucial event took place. The reigning emperor, <a href="#hadrian2">Hadrian</a>, was childless. An illness had brought him near to death a year previously, and it was clear that he would not live forever. Hadrian owed his throne to his adoption by his predecessor and distant relative, <a href="#trajan">Trajan</a>. Following Trajan’s example, Hadrian had designated the distinguished aristocrat <a href="#verus3">Lucius Ceionius Commodus</a> to succeed him. In 137, however, Ceionius died unexpectedly, and Hadrian was forced to cast about for a new successor. His choice fell on the childless senator <a href="#antoninus">Antoninus</a>, whom he selected with the proviso that <a href="#antoninus">Antoninus</a> should in turn adopt Marcus (his nephew by marriage) along with Ceionius’s son <a href="#verus3">Lucius Verus</a>, then aged seven. Marcus took on the family name of his adopted father, becoming <a href="#marcus-aurelius-antoninus">Marcus Aurelius Antoninus</a>.</p>
      <p>Hadrian’s death the following year left Marcus first in line for the throne. His education and that of the younger Verus were now matters of still greater concern, and it is clear that no expense was spared. For training in Greek rhetoric, he was entrusted to Herodes Atticus, a fabulously wealthy Athenian rhetorician whose tempestuous relations with his family, fellow citizens and the imperial court itself would have furnished ample material for a soap opera. His instructor in Latin oratory was <a href="#fronto">Marcus Cornelius Fronto</a>, a prominent rhetorician from Cirta in North Africa. By an accident of fate, many of Fronto’s letters to Marcus have survived, and they illustrate the close relationship between student and teacher. They also suggest Fronto’s regret at seeing Marcus move away from rhetoric to delve ever more deeply into philosophy. The <a href="#book1">first book</a> of the <em>Meditations</em> pays tribute to a number of philosophers from whom Marcus learned, both formally and informally, and he is likely to have studied with or listened to many others.</p>
      <p>Marcus would have learned much outside the classroom as well. For training in legal and political matters, an informal apprenticeship bound aristocratic youths to older public figures&mdash;men like Junius Rusticus, whose influence Marcus chronicles in <a href="#book1-7">1.7</a>. But the single greatest influence was surely Marcus’s adopted father, <a href="#antoninus">Antoninus Pius</a>. Marcus would have watched as Antoninus received embassies, tried legal cases and dictated letters to his deputies. Meanwhile Marcus’s own position as heir apparent was signaled in various ways. In 140 he served as consul (at the age of nineteen), and would serve again in 145. In the same year he married Antoninus’s daughter Faustina, to whom he pays tribute in <em>Meditations</em> <a href="#book1-17">1.17</a>.</p>
      <p>Edward Gibbon’s <em>History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em> describes the reign of Antoninus as “furnishing very few materials for history, which is indeed little more than the register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind.” It furnishes equally little material for Marcus’s biography. In the decade and a half between 145 and 161 we learn little of Marcus’s occupations, and our only glimpses of his inner development come from his correspondence with <a href="#fronto">Fronto</a>. But the two poles that would govern the remainder of his life&mdash;the court and philosophy&mdash;seem by this point to be fully established. There is no evidence that Marcus experienced anything like the “conversion” to philosophy that some ancient figures experienced (or affected), but it is clear that by the middle to late 140s philosophy was becoming increasingly central to his life.</p>
      <p>On August 31, 161, Antoninus died, leaving Marcus as his sole successor. Marcus immediately acted to carry out what appears to have been Hadrian’s original intention (perhaps ignored by Antoninus) by pushing through the appointment of his adopted brother, Lucius Verus, as co-regent. Verus’s character has suffered by comparison with Marcus’s. Ancient sources, in particular the gossipy <em>Historia Augusta</em>, tend to paint him as a self-indulgent degenerate&mdash;almost another Nero. This may be unfair; it is certainly not the picture of him we get from Marcus’s own reminiscences in the <em>Meditations</em>. It does seem clear, however, that Marcus functioned as the senior emperor in fact if not name. It would be surprising if he had not. He was almost a decade older, and had been trained for the position by Antoninus himself.</p>
      <p>What kind of ruler did this philosopher-king prove to be? Not, perhaps, as different from his predecessors as one might have expected. Though an emperor was all-powerful in theory, his ability to control policy was in reality much more limited. Much of his time was spent fielding problems that had moved up the administrative ladder: receiving embassies from the large cities of the empire, trying appeals of criminal cases, answering queries from provincial governors and dealing with petitions from individuals. Even with a functional system of imperial couriers, news could take weeks to travel from the periphery of the empire to the center; imperial edicts took time to move down the chain of command. While the emperor’s decision had the force of law, enforcement was almost entirely in the hands of provincial governors, whose diligence might be affected by incompetence, corruption, or an understandable desire not to antagonize local elites.</p>
      <p>We get occasional glimpses of Marcus’s day-to-day duties from the evidence of imperial decisions preserved in letters, inscriptions and the legal codes. Surviving legislation shows a certain interest in the freeing of slaves and in regulations relating to the guardianship of orphans. Attempts have been made to tie the first to Marcus’s philosophical convictions and the second to his own memories of life without a father. But it remains unclear how much of the policy is due to Marcus himself, and how far it differs from that of Marcus’s predecessor, Antoninus. Perhaps more interesting are the traces of Marcus’s personality to be discerned in the phrasing of imperial documents, where we find a scrupulous attention to detail and a self-consciousness about linguistic usage that seems to differentiate Marcus from his predecessors. Neither trait surprises in the author of the <em>Meditations</em> or a student of <a href="#fronto">Fronto</a>, whose extant letters place great stress on the quest for the <em>mot juste</em>.</p>
      <p>One of Marcus’s priorities was to preserve good relations with the Senate. The goal was to disguise the absoluteness with which the emperor ruled: to preserve a facade&mdash;and sometimes, no doubt, even to achieve the reality&mdash;of consensus and cooperation. A hundred years before, aristocrats might have dreamed of a restored Republic (as some certainly did). But by the second century it was clear that there was no alternative to the principate. The Senate expected deference in public and hoped for influence behind the scenes; “good” emperors were willing to play along. In cultivating the upper classes Marcus was following in the footsteps of Antoninus and Trajan, rather than of Hadrian, whose relations with the Senate had been prickly. And it is this, as much as anything else, that is responsible for his reputation as a benevolent statesman. An emperor might do as he liked while he lived, but it was the senatorial historians&mdash;men like Cornelius Tacitus in the 120s or Cassius Dio in the generation after Marcus’s death&mdash;who had the last word.</p>
      <p>Another area where Marcus’s policy continued that of his predecessors related to a small and eccentric sect known as the Christians. In the course of the next century they would become an increasing problem for the imperial administration, and they were prominent enough in Marcus’s day to attract an extended denunciation from a certain Celsus, part of whose work “Against the Christians” still survives. The sect met with contempt from those intellectuals who deigned to take notice of it (Marcus’s tutor <a href="#fronto">Fronto</a> was evidently one), and with suspicion and hostility from ordinary citizens and administrators. The Christians’ disfavor stemmed from their failure to acknowledge the gods worshipped by the community around them. Their “atheism”&mdash;their refusal to accept any god but their own&mdash;endangered their neighbors as well as themselves, and their reluctance to acknowledge the divine status of the emperor threatened the social order and the well-being of the state.</p>
      <p>Christianity had been illegal since the early second century when a query from Pliny the Younger (then governor of Bithynia in Asia Minor) prompted the emperor Trajan to establish a formal policy: While Christians were not to be sought out, those who confessed to the faith were to be executed. But empire-wide persecution did not become a reality until a much later date. The main threat to Christians in the second century came from individual provincial governors, acting either on their own initiative or under pressure from local communities. In the late 170s, for example, civic unrest at Lyons resulted in a virtual pogrom of Greek-speaking Christians resident there. Marcus’s mentor Junius Rusticus had tried and executed Christians (the apologist Justin Martyr among them) in his capacity as city prefect. Marcus himself was no doubt aware of Christianity, but there is no reason to think that it bulked large in his mind. The one direct reference to it in the <em>Meditations</em> (<a href="#book11-3">11.3</a>) is almost certainly a later interpolation, and the implicit references some scholars have discerned are surely illusory.</p>
      <p>Marcus, in any case, had more serious concerns than this troublesome cult. Soon after his accession, relations between Rome and its only rival, the Parthian empire in the East, took a dramatic turn for the worse. Since at least the time of Trajan the two states had been locked in a cold war that would continue for the next two centuries, and that once a generation or so flared up into a military conflict. The death of Antoninus and the accession of two new and untried rulers may have tempted the Parthian ruler Vologaeses III to test the waters. In 162 his forces occupied Armenia and wiped out a Roman garrison that had gone to the rescue. Syria itself was threatened. Rome had no choice but to respond.</p>
      <p>It was Verus, the younger emperor, who was sent east, where he remained for the next four years. Neither he nor Marcus had any military experience to speak of (Antoninus’s peaceful reign had given little scope for it), and the day-to-day conduct of the war was no doubt left to the professionals. After initial setbacks the Romans rallied and, under such commanders as the dynamic young Avidius Cassius, forced the Parthians to sue for peace. Parthia would remain a threat, but one that could be dealt with by diplomatic means for the immediate future.</p>
      <p>Verus and his senior colleague had no time to bask in their triumph, however. Within a year the empire was in the grip of a devastating plague, apparently brought back from the East by Lucius’s troops. Its effects may not have been quite as apocalyptic as later writers suggest, but the death toll was certainly high, and it also delayed the emperors’ response to a second threat. This was the increasing instability on the empire’s other border, the northern frontier that separated Rome from the barbarian peoples of Germany, eastern Europe and Scandinavia. During this period a number of these tribes were under pressure from peoples farther north and reacted by moving across the empire’s borders&mdash;not for conquest, but in search of land to settle. Rome’s reaction alternated between aggressive resistance and attempts at accommodation; its failure to develop a workable policy would eventually result in the collapse of the Western empire some three centuries later.</p>
      <p>In some places a line could be drawn. Hadrian’s great wall, stretching across Britain, was intended to secure the empire’s most distant frontier; under Antoninus it had been briefly superseded by a second line farther to the north. But such fortifications were impracticable on the continent, and it was there that the threat was concentrated. Rome still remembered the catastrophe of <abbr title="Anno Domini">A.D.</abbr> 9, when the Roman general Varus and three legions had marched into the forests of Germany, never to return. In the second century, the greatest source of anxiety was the area farther south, roughly corresponding to modern-day Romania and Hungary. Trajan’s conquest of Dacia two generations before had cleared out a possible source of trouble, but the potential for friction remained. In Marcus’s day three peoples presented a special problem: the Quadi, the Marcomanni, and the Jazyges, also called Sarmatians. The removal of three legions to Parthia had seriously weakened the Roman position on the northern frontier, and barbarians took advantage of the situation. In 168, Marcus and Verus marched north to deal with them.</p>
      <p>Much of the remainder of the reign would be spent on intermittent warfare, first in the so-called Marcomannic Wars of the early 170s and then in a second campaign later in that decade. And most of the burden was to be borne by Marcus alone, for Verus died suddenly (apparently of a stroke) in early 169. It was a very different kind of war than the traditional campaign Verus’s armies had waged. The conventional military and diplomatic tactics that worked against the Parthians were of limited use here. Instead, the Romans had to negotiate with individual chieftains whose authority was limited and whose reliability was always in doubt. When negotiation failed, the only alternative was a slow and bloody succession of small-scale engagements rather than pitched battles. The progress of the campaign is recorded on the column erected in Rome to commemorate the close of the Marcomannic Wars. In spite of its triumphal purpose, the engraved scenes that spiral around the monument paint a grim picture of brutal fighting, devastation and execution. “Spiders are proud of catching flies,” Marcus notes mordantly, “men of catching hares, fish in a net, boars, bears, Sarmatians” (<a href="#book10-10">10.10</a>). The gruesome vignette that opens <em>Meditations</em> <a href="#book8-34">8.34</a> (“a severed hand or foot, or a decapitated head”) may well reflect Marcus’s own experience.</p>
      <p>By 175 the Romans seemed to have gained the upper hand. But at this point disturbing news arrived. Avidius Cassius, who had distinguished himself as a general during the Parthian War and who as governor of Syria now served as virtual regent of the Eastern empire, had revolted and declared himself emperor. Some of the Eastern provinces (notably Cappadocia) remained loyal to Marcus, but Cassius was recognized as emperor throughout much of the East, and in particular in Egypt, whose grain supply was crucial to the capital. Civil war seemed inevitable, and was prevented only by Cassius’s assassination at the hands of a subordinate. Marcus was nevertheless obliged to travel east to reassert his authority, taking with him Faustina (who died in the course of the journey). He visited the major cities of the East, Antioch and Alexandria, arriving finally at Athens, where he was initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries, a set of mystic rites connected with the worship of Demeter, the goddess of agriculture.</p>
      <p>Now in his fifties, Marcus was in declining health, and the revolt of Cassius had only underlined the need to make arrangements for the succession. Faustina had borne at least thirteen children, many of whom had died young. By the mid- 170s, Marcus had only one surviving son, Commodus, just entering his teens. There was no reason for Marcus to continue the policy of adoption followed by his predecessors, and there is no reason to think he even considered it. The years that follow see Commodus’s rapid promotion to a position not far short of co-emperor. He was consul in 177 at the age of fifteen. In the same year he was accorded all the major imperial privileges, except for the post of Pontifex Maximus, the head of the Roman state religion, held by the reigning emperor alone, and for life.</p>
      <p>The gains of the Marcomannic Wars had not proved permanent, and in 178, Marcus and Commodus marched north again. Two years later Marcus died at age fifty-eight, the first emperor to pass on the throne to his son since Vespasian a century before. Sadly, Commodus’s performance did not bear out whatever promise Marcus had discerned in him. He was to be remembered as a dissolute tyrant, a second Caligula or Nero whose many defects were only emphasized by the contrast with his father. His assassination after a twelve-year reign would usher in the first in a series of power struggles that would burden the empire for the next century.</p>
      <h3 id="philosophical-background"><a href="#philosophical-background">&#35;</a> Philosophical Background <a href="#header" title="Back to top">&uarr;</a></h3>
      <p>The composition of the <em>Meditations</em> is normally dated to the 170s&mdash;Marcus’s last decade. That this was a dark and stressful period for him can hardly be doubted. In the ten years between 169 and 179 he had to cope with constant fighting on the frontier, the abortive revolt of Cassius, and the deaths of his colleague Verus; his wife, Faustina; and others. Though he could hardly have anticipated the century of turmoil that would follow his death, he may have suspected that his son and successor, Commodus, was not the man he hoped. That in these circumstances Marcus should have sought consolation in philosophy is only natural. But understanding what Marcus looked for from his philosophical studies requires a certain amount of orientation. To understand the <em>Meditations</em> in context, we must familiarize ourselves not only with Stoicism, the philosophical system that underlies the work, but also with the role of philosophy in ancient life more generally.</p>
      <p>Today philosophy is an academic discipline, one that few people other than professional philosophers would consider central to their everyday existence. While we may think of ourselves as having a “philosophy of life,” it bears little relation to what goes on in the philosophy departments of our universities. The careers of twentieth-century analytic philosophy often seem remote from what the American philosopher Thomas Nagel terms “mortal questions”: the problems involved in making ethical choices, constructing a just society, responding to suffering and loss, and coming to terms with the prospect of death. Indeed, most of us would be inclined to see these issues as the province of religion rather than philosophy.</p>
      <p>For Marcus and his contemporaries, the situation was very different. Ancient philosophy certainly had its academic side. Athens and other large cities had publicly financed chairs of philosophy, and professional philosophers taught, argued and wrote, as they do today. But philosophy also had a more practical dimension. It was not merely a subject to write or argue about, but one that was expected to provide a “design for living”&mdash;a set of rules to live one’s life by. This was a need not met by ancient religion, which privileged ritual over doctrine and provided little in the way of moral and ethical guidelines. Nor did anyone expect it to. That was what philosophy was for.</p>
      <p>Philosophy in the modern sense is largely the creation of one man, the fifth-century <abbr title="before Christ">B.C.</abbr> Athenian thinker <a href="#socrates">Socrates</a>. But it is primarily in the Hellenistic period that we see the rise of philosophical sects, promulgating coherent “belief systems” that an individual could accept as a whole and which were designed to explain the world in its totality. Of these Hellenistic systems the most important, both for Romans in general and for Marcus in particular, was the Stoic school. The movement takes its name from the stoa (“porch” or “portico”) in downtown Athens where its founder, Zeno (332/3–262 <abbr title="before Christ">B.C.</abbr>), taught and lectured. Zeno’s doctrines were reformulated and developed by his successors, Cleanthes (331–232 <abbr title="before Christ">B.C.</abbr>) and <a href="#chrysippus">Chrysippus</a> (280–c. 206 <abbr title="before Christ">B.C.</abbr>). Chrysippus in particular was a voluminous writer, and it was he who laid the foundations for systematic Stoicism. This early “academic” Stoicism is the source of certain key terms and concepts that reappear frequently in the <em>Meditations</em>, and proper understanding of Marcus’s approach requires some familiarity with the system as a whole.</p>
      <h4 id="stoicism"><a href="#stoicism">&#35;</a> Stoicism <a href="#header" title="Back to top">&uarr;</a></h4>
      <p>Of the doctrines central to the Stoic worldview, perhaps the most important is the unwavering conviction that the world is organized in a rational and coherent way. More specifically, it is controlled and directed by an all-pervading force that the Stoics designated by the term <em>logos</em>. The term (from which English “logic” and the suffix “-logy” derive) has a semantic range so broad as to be almost untranslatable. At a basic level it designates rational, connected thought&mdash;whether envisioned as a characteristic (rationality, the ability to reason) or as the product of that characteristic (an intelligible utterance or a connected discourse). <em>Logos</em> operates both in individuals and in the universe as a whole. In individuals it is the faculty of reason. On a cosmic level it is the rational principle that governs the organization of the universe.<sup><a href="#in1" id="in1-ref">1</a></sup> In this sense it is synonymous with “nature,” “Providence,” or “God.” (When the author of John’s Gospel tells us that “the Word”&mdash;<em>logos</em>&mdash;was with God and is to be identified with God, he is borrowing Stoic terminology.)</p>
      <p>All events are determined by the <em>logos</em>, and follow in an unbreakable chain of cause and effect. Stoicism is thus from the outset a deterministic system that appears to leave no room for human free will or moral responsibility. In reality the Stoics were reluctant to accept such an arrangement, and attempted to get around the difficulty by defining free will as a voluntary accommodation to what is in any case inevitable. According to this theory, man is like a dog tied to a moving wagon. If the dog refuses to run along with the wagon he will be dragged by it, yet the choice remains his: to run or be dragged. In the same way, humans are responsible for their choices and actions, even though these have been anticipated by the <em>logos</em> and form part of its plan. Even actions which appear to be&mdash;and indeed are&mdash;immoral or unjust advance the overall design, which taken as a whole is harmonious and good. They, too, are governed by the <em>logos</em>.</p>
      <p>But the <em>logos</em> is not simply an impersonal power that governs and directs the world. It is also an actual substance that pervades that world, not in a metaphorical sense but in a form as concrete as oxygen or carbon. In its physical embodiment, the <em>logos</em> exists as <em>pneuma</em>, a substance imagined by the earliest Stoics as pure fire, and by <a href="#chrysippus">Chrysippus</a> as a mixture of fire and air. <em>Pneuma</em> is the power&mdash;the vital breath&mdash;that animates animals and humans. It is, in Dylan Thomas’s phrase, “the force that through the green fuse drives the flower,” and is present even in lifeless materials like stone or metal as the energy that holds the object together&mdash;the internal tension that makes a stone a stone. All objects are thus a compound of lifeless substance and vital force. When Marcus refers, as he does on a number of occasions, to “cause and material” he means the two elements of these compounds&mdash;inert substance and animating <em>pneuma</em>&mdash;which are united so long as the object itself exists. When the object perishes, the <em>pneuma</em> that animated it is reabsorbed into the <em>logos</em> as a whole. This process of destruction and reintegration happens to individual objects at every moment. It also happens on a larger scale to the entire universe, which at vast intervals is entirely consumed by fire (a process known as <em>ekpyrosis</em>), and then regenerated.<sup><a href="#in2" id="in2-ref">2</a></sup></p>
      <p>If the world is indeed orderly, if the <em>logos</em> controls all things, then the order it produces should be discernible in all aspects of it. That supposition not only led the Stoics to speculate about the nature of the physical world but also motivated them to seek the rationality characteristic of the <em>logos</em> in other areas, notably in formal logic and the nature and structure of language (their interest in etymology is reflected in several entries in the <em>Meditations</em>). This systematizing impulse reappears in many other fields as well. The catalogue of <a href="#chrysippus">Chrysippus’s</a> own works preserved by the late-third-century biographer Diogenes Laertius is very long indeed; it includes not only philosophical treatises in a narrow sense, but also works such as “On How to Read Poetry” and “Against the Touching Up of Paintings.” Later Stoics would try their hands at history and anthropology as well as more conventionally philosophical topics.</p>
      <p>The expansion of Stoic thought was not only intellectual but also geographical. The movement had been born in Athens. In the century and a half that followed <a href="#chrysippus">Chrysippus’s</a> death it spread to other centers, in particular to Rome. The Romans of the second century <abbr title="before Christ">B.C.</abbr> were in the midst of a course of conquest that by the end of the century would leave them the effective masters of the Mediterranean. With conquest came culture. Looking back on the rapid Hellenization of the Roman aristocracy between 200 <abbr title="before Christ">B.C.</abbr> and his own day, the poet Horace famously observed that “conquered Greece was the true conqueror.” Nowhere is the influence of Greece more obvious than in philosophy. Greek philosophers, including the Stoics, Panaetius (c. 185–109 <abbr title="before Christ">B.C.</abbr>), and Posidonius (c. 135–50 <abbr title="before Christ">B.C.</abbr>), visited Rome to lecture. Many spent extended periods there. In the first century <abbr title="before Christ">B.C.</abbr> it became the fashion for young upper-class Romans to study in Athens, in an ancient version of the eighteenth-century Grand Tour. Roman aristocrats acted as patrons to individual philosophers and assembled large libraries of philosophical texts (like that at the famous Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum), and Romans like Cicero and Lucretius attempted to expound Greek philosophical doctrines in Latin.</p>
      <p>Of the major philosophical schools, it was Stoicism that had the greatest appeal. Unlike some other sects, the Stoics had always approved of participation in public life, and this stand struck a chord with the Roman aristocracy, whose code of values placed a premium on political and military activity. Stoicism has even been described, not altogether unfairly, as the real religion of upper-class Romans. In the process it became a rather different version of the philosophy from that taught by Zeno and <a href="#chrysippus">Chrysippus</a>. Perhaps the most important development was a shift in emphasis, a narrowing of focus. Early and middle Stoicism was a holistic system. It aimed to embrace all knowledge, and its focus was speculative and theoretical. Roman Stoicism, by contrast, was a practical discipline&mdash;not an abstract system of thought, but an attitude to life. Partly for historical reasons, it is this Romanized Stoicism that has most influenced later generations. Indeed, the application of the adjective “stoic” to a person who shows strength and courage in misfortune probably owes more to the aristocratic Roman value system than it does to Greek philosophers.</p>
      <p>Stoicism in its later form was a system inspired as much by individuals as by texts or doctrines. One of its most distinguished adherents was Marcus Cato (known as Cato the Younger to distinguish him from his great-grandfather, prominent a century earlier). A senator of renowned rectitude when Julius Caesar marched on Rome in 49 <abbr title="before Christ">B.C.</abbr>, Cato sided with Caesar’s rival Pompey in defense of the legitimate government. When it was clear that Caesar would triumph, Cato chose not to survive the Republic, killing himself after the battle of Munda in 46. Within a century he had become an emblem of Stoic resistance to tyranny. Under Nero he was immortalized by the poet Lucan and praised in a laudatory biography by the senator Thrasea Paetus, whose own resistance to Nero cost him his life. Thrasea’s son-in-law, Helvidius Priscus, played a similar role&mdash;and came to a similar end&mdash;under Vespasian. Thrasea and Helvidius in their turn served as role models to second-century aristocrats like Marcus’s mentors Rusticus, Maximus, and Severus. Marcus himself pays tribute to them (and to Cato) in <em>Meditations</em> <a href="#book1-14">1.14</a>.</p>
      <p>Cato, Thrasea, and Helvidius were doers, not writers, and their legendary heroism inevitably lends them a somewhat two-dimensional quality. A more complex and much more interesting figure was the poet Lucan’s uncle, Lucius Annaeus Seneca (c. 4 <abbr title="before Christ">B.C.</abbr>–<abbr title="Anno Domini">A.D.</abbr> 65), commonly known as Seneca the Younger to distinguish him from his equally distinguished father. Originally councillor to the young Nero, he was eventually forced to commit suicide after being implicated in an attempted coup against his erstwhile pupil. Men’s lives are not always consistent with their ideals, and some critics have found it hard to reconcile Seneca’s fabulous wealth and his shameless flattery of Nero with his philosophical views. Yet his works (in particular the <em>Letters to Lucilius</em>) remain the most engaging and accessible expressions of later Stoicism. Because they were written in Latin they were also among the most influential on succeeding generations.</p>
      <p>But not all Stoics were wealthy senators. There was another kind of Stoic exemplar as well: the outsider whose ascetic lifestyle won him the admiration of his wealthier contemporaries and enabled him to criticize the pretenses of upper-class society with real authority. An early example of the type is Gaius Musonius Rufus (c. 30–100), a member of the Roman administrative class, the so-called knights (<em>equites</em>), who was banished by both Nero and Vespasian. A still more dramatic example was Musonius’s student Epictetus (c. 55–c. 135), who had taken up the practice of philosophy as a slave and devoted the remainder of his life to it after being freed. He had been exiled to Nicopolis (in northern Greece) under Domitian, and after the tyrant’s death, elected to remain there where he taught and lectured to visitors who often traveled great distances to study with him.</p>
      <p>One of these was the upper-class historian and statesman Arrian (c. 86–160), who published an extensive record of the master’s discussions, a text conventionally referred to as the <em><a href="https://vreeman.com/discourses/">Discourses of Epictetus</a></em>. He later produced an abridged version, <a href="https://vreeman.com/discourses/#enchiridion">the <em>Enchiridion</em> (“Manual” or “Handbook”)</a>. Epictetus seems to have been an especially important figure for Marcus. He thanks his philosophical mentor Rusticus for introducing him to “Epictetus’s lectures” (either the <em><a href="https://vreeman.com/discourses/">Discourses</a></em> themselves or a private set of lecture notes), and a series of quotations and paraphrases from the philosopher appear in <a href="#book11">Book 11</a> of the <em>Meditations</em>. And Arrian’s abridged <a href="https://vreeman.com/discourses/#enchiridion"><em>Enchiridion</em></a> provides the closest literary parallel to the <em>Meditations</em> itself, not only in its content, but also in its form: a series of relatively short and unrelated entries.</p>
      <h4 id="stoicism-and-the-meditations"><a href="#stoicism-and-the-meditations">&#35;</a> Stoicism and the <em>Meditations</em> <a href="#header" title="Back to top">&uarr;</a></h4>
      <p>The late Stoicism of Epictetus is a radically stripped-down version of its Hellenistic predecessor, a philosophy which “had learnt much from its competitors and had almost forgotten parts of itself.”<sup><a href="#in3" id="in3-ref">3</a></sup> Both these tendencies, the narrowing of the field and the eclectic borrowing from non-Stoic sources, can be discerned also in the <em>Meditations</em>.</p>
      <p><a href="#chrysippus">Chrysippus</a> and his followers had divided knowledge into three areas: logic, physics and ethics, concerned, respectively, with the nature of knowledge, the structure of the physical world and the proper role of human beings in that world. Marcus pays lip service to this triadic division in at least one entry (<a href="#book8-13">8.13</a>), but it is clear from other chapters and from the <em>Meditations</em> as a whole that logic and physics were not his focus. Among the things for which he thanks the gods is that he was never “absorbed by logic-chopping, or preoccupied by physics” (<a href="#book1-17">1.17</a>). Occasional entries show an awareness of Stoic thought about language (the etymological pun in <a href="#book8-57">8.57</a> is perhaps the clearest example), but they are the exception, not the rule. In many cases Marcus’s logic is weak&mdash;the logic of the rhetorician, not of the philosopher; it is rare to find a developed chain of reasoning like that in <em>Meditations</em> <a href="#book4-4">4.4</a>. His interest in the nature of the physical world is limited to its relevance to human problems. About one of the basic Stoic physical doctrines&mdash;the notion of the periodic conflagration (<em>ekpyrosis</em>) that ends a cosmic cycle&mdash;Marcus adopts an agnostic position (though he was not alone in this). To him it was ethics that was the basis of the system: “just because you’ve abandoned your hopes of becoming a great thinker or scientist, don’t give up on attaining freedom, achieving humility, serving others &hellip;” (<a href="#book7-67">7.67</a>).</p>
      <p>The questions that the <em>Meditations</em> tries to answer are primarily metaphysical and ethical ones: Why are we here? How should we live our lives? How can we ensure that we do what is right? How can we protect ourselves against the stresses and pressures of daily life? How should we deal with pain and misfortune? How can we live with the knowledge that someday we will no longer exist? It would be both pointless and impertinent to try to summarize Marcus’s responses; the influence of the <em>Meditations</em> on later readers springs in part from the clarity and insistence with which he addresses these questions. It may be worthwhile, however, to draw attention to one pattern of thought that is central to the philosophy of the <em>Meditations</em> (as well as to Epictetus), and that has been identified and documented in detail by Pierre Hadot. This is the doctrine of the three “disciplines”: the disciplines of perception, of action and of the will.</p>
      <p>The discipline of perception requires that we maintain absolute objectivity of thought: that we see things dispassionately for what they are. Proper understanding of this point requires a brief introduction to the Stoic theory of cognition. We have seen that for the Stoics universal order is represented by the <em>logos</em>. The <em>logos</em> infuses and is wielded by our <em>hegemonikon</em> (literally, “that which guides”), which is the intellective part of our consciousness. In different contexts it can approximate either “will” or “character” and it performs many of the functions that English speakers attribute to the brain or the heart.<sup><a href="#in4" id="in4-ref">4</a></sup> One of its primary functions is to process and assess the data we receive from our senses. At every instant the objects and events in the world around us bombard us with impressions. As they do so they produce a <em>phantasia</em>, a mental impression. From this the mind generates a perception (<em>hypolepsis</em>), which might best be compared to a print made from a photographic negative. Ideally this print will be an accurate and faithful representation of the original. But it may not be. It may be blurred, or it may include shadow images that distort or obscure the original.</p>
      <p>Chief among these are inappropriate value judgments: the designation as “good” or “evil” of things that in fact are neither good nor evil. For example, my impression that my house has just burned down is simply that&mdash;an impression or report conveyed to me by my senses about an event in the outside world. By contrast, my perception that my house has burned down and I have thereby suffered a terrible tragedy includes not only an impression, but also an interpretation imposed upon that initial impression by my powers of <em>hypolepsis</em>. It is by no means the only possible interpretation, and I am not obliged to accept it. I may be a good deal better off if I decline to do so. It is, in other words, not objects and events but the interpretations we place on them that are the problem. Our duty is therefore to exercise stringent control over the faculty of perception, with the aim of protecting our mind from error.</p>
      <p>The second discipline, that of action, relates to our relationship with other people. Human beings, for Marcus as for the Stoics generally, are social animals, a point he makes often (e.g., <a href="#book5-16">5.16</a>, <a href="#book8-59">8.59</a>, <a href="#book9-1">9.1</a>). All human beings possess not only a share of the <em>logos</em> but also the ability to use it (that is what makes us human and distinguishes us from other animals). But it would perhaps be more accurate to say that we are <em>participants</em> in the <em>logos</em>, which is as much a process as a substance. Marcus himself more than once compares the world ruled by <em>logos</em> to a city in which all human beings are citizens, with all the duties inherent in citizenship. As human beings we are part of nature, and our duty is to accommodate ourselves to its demands and requirements&mdash;“to live as nature requires,” as Marcus often puts it. To do this we must make proper use of the <em>logos</em> we have been allotted, and perform as best we can the functions assigned us in the master plan of the larger, cosmic <em>logos</em>, of which it is a part. This requires not merely passive acquiescence in what happens, but active cooperation with the world, with fate and, above all, with other human beings. We were made, Marcus tells us over and over, not for ourselves but for others, and our nature is fundamentally unselfish. In our relationships with others we must work for their collective good, while treating them justly and fairly as individuals.</p>
      <p>Marcus never defines what he means by justice, and it is important to recognize what the term implies and what it does not. All human beings have a share of the <em>logos</em>, and all have roles to play in the vast design that is the world. But this is not to say that all humans are equal or that the roles they are assigned are interchangeable. Marcus, like most of his contemporaries, took it for granted that human society was hierarchical, and this is borne out by the images he uses to describe it. Human society is a single organism, like an individual human body or a tree. But the trunk of the tree is not to be confused with the leaves, or the hands and feet with the head. Our duty to act justly does not mean that we must treat others as our equals; it means that we must treat them as they deserve. And their deserts are determined in part by their position in the hierarchy. Stoicism’s emphasis on the orderliness of the universe implies a similar orderliness and harmony in its parts, and part of its appeal to upper-class Romans may have been that it did not force its adherents to ask difficult questions about the organization of the society they lived in.<sup><a href="#in5" id="in5-ref">5</a></sup></p>
      <p>The third discipline, the discipline of will, is in a sense the counterpart to the second, the discipline of action. The latter governs our approach to the things in our control, those that we do; the discipline of will governs our attitude to things that are <em>not</em> within our control, those that we have done <em>to</em> us (by others or by nature). We control our own actions and are responsible for them. If we act wrongly, then we have done serious harm to ourselves (though not, it should be emphasized, to others, or to the <em>logos</em>). By contrast, things outside our control have no ability to harm us. Acts of wrongdoing by a human agent (torture, theft, or other crimes) harm the agent, not the victim. Acts of nature such as fire, illness, or death can harm us only if we choose to see them as harmful. When we do so, we question the benevolence and providence of the <em>logos</em>, and thereby degrade our own <em>logos</em>.</p>
      <p>This, of course, we must not do. Instead we must see things for what they are (here the discipline of perception is relevant) and accept them, by exercising the discipline of will, or what Epictetus calls (in a phrase quoted by Marcus) “the art of acquiescence.” For if we recognize that all events have been foreseen by the <em>logos</em> and form part of its plan, and that the plan in question is unfailingly good (as it must be), then it follows that we must accept whatever fate has in store for us, however unpleasant it may appear, trusting that, in Alexander Pope’s phrase, “whatever is, is right.” This applies to all obstacles and (apparent) misfortunes, and in particular to death&mdash;a process that we cannot prevent, which therefore does not harm us, and which accordingly we must accept willingly as natural and proper.</p>
      <p>Together, the three disciplines constitute a comprehensive approach to life, and in various combinations and reformulations they underlie a large number of the entries in the <em>Meditations</em>. We see them laid out starkly and explicitly in <em>Meditations</em> <a href="#book7-54">7.54</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option:
        <ul>
          <li>to accept this event with humility [will];</li>
          <li>to treat this person as he should be treated [action];</li>
          <li>to approach this thought with care, so that nothing irrational creeps in [perception].</li>
        </ul></blockquote>
      <p>We find the same triad rephrased and reordered in <em>Meditations</em> <a href="#book9-6">9.6</a>:</p>
      <blockquote><p>Objective judgment &hellip; Unselfish action &hellip; Willing acceptance &hellip; of all external events.</p></blockquote>
      <p>And we find it in a more subtle form underlying <em>Meditations</em> <a href="#book8-7">8.7</a>:</p>
      <blockquote><p>&hellip; progress for a rational mind means not accepting falsehood or uncertainty in its perceptions, making unselfish actions its only aim, seeking and shunning only the things it has control over, embracing what nature demands of it&mdash;the nature in which it participates, as the leaf’s nature does in the tree’s.</p></blockquote>
      <p>A score of other entries could be cited. The almost obsessive repetition of these three points suggests that they lie at the very heart of Marcus’s thought, and of his project in the <em>Meditations</em>.</p>
      <h4 id="other-influences"><a href="#other-influences">&#35;</a> Other Influences <a href="#header" title="Back to top">&uarr;</a></h4>
      <p>Marcus Aurelius is often thought of and referred to as the quintessential Stoic. Yet the only explicit reference to Stoicism in the <em>Meditations</em> (<a href="#book5-10">5.10</a>) is phrased in curiously distant terms, as if it were merely one school among others. The great figures of early Stoicism are conspicuous by their absence. Neither Zeno nor Cleanthes is mentioned in the <em>Meditations</em>, and <a href="#chrysippus">Chrysippus</a> appears only twice&mdash;quoted once in passing for a pithy comparison (<a href="#book6-42">6.42</a>) and included with <a href="#socrates">Socrates</a> and <a href="#epictetus">Epictetus</a> in a list of dead thinkers (<a href="#book7-19">7.19</a>). This is not to deny the essentially Stoic basis of Marcus’s thought, or the deep influence on him exercised by later Stoic thinkers (most obviously Epictetus). If he had to be identified with a particular school, that is surely the one he would have chosen. Yet I suspect that if asked what it was that he studied, his answer would have been not “Stoicism” but simply “philosophy.”</p>
      <p>There is nothing surprising about this. The imperial period saw the development of a widespread ecumenical tendency in philosophy. Adherents of most of the major schools&mdash;the Platonists, Peripatetics, Cynics, and Stoics&mdash;preferred to focus on the points they shared, rather than those that separated them. Not all the figures Marcus credits as influential on his own philosophical development were Stoics; Severus, for example, was a Peripatetic. Although authors like Seneca and <a href="#epictetus">Epictetus</a> accepted the basic premises of the system developed by Zeno and <a href="#chrysippus">Chrysippus</a>, they showed no reluctance to borrow aphorisms, anecdotes, and argumentative strategies from non-Stoic sources. The <em>Meditations</em> follows a similar procedure. While built on a Stoic foundation, it also refers to and quotes a wide range of figures, both precursors of the Stoics and representatives of rival schools.</p>
      <p>Of the predecessors Marcus invokes, the most important is surely <a href="#socrates">Socrates</a>, the great Athenian thinker who had helped redirect philosophy from a preoccupation with the physical world to a focus on the role of man in society and the nature of human morality. Socrates himself wrote nothing. His teachings were transmitted (and greatly elaborated) in the philosophical dialogues of his student <a href="#plato">Plato</a>. Marcus quotes Plato repeatedly (especially in <a href="#book7">Book 7</a>), and Socratic or Platonic elements can be discerned elsewhere too. One example is the so-called Socratic paradox, the claim that no one does wrong willingly, and that if men were able to recognize what is right, they would inevitably do it. “They are like this,” Marcus says of other people, “because they can’t tell good from evil” (<a href="#book2-1">2.1</a>), and he repeats this assertion elsewhere.</p>
      <p><a href="#socrates">Socrates’</a> character was as important as his doctrines. His legendary endurance and self-denial made him an ideal model for the Stoic philosopher&mdash;or any philosopher. His refusal to compromise his philosophical beliefs led him to make the ultimate sacrifice when he was put on trial at the age of seventy on trumped-up charges of impiety. His display of integrity at the trial and his comportment in the days leading up to his execution made it easy to view him as a forerunner of first-century Stoic martyrs like Thrasea Paetus or Helvidius Priscus, and it is in this light that Marcus evokes him in <em>Meditations</em> <a href="#book7-66">7.66</a>.</p>
      <p>Of <a href="#socrates">Socrates’</a> predecessors (the so-called pre-Socratic thinkers), the most important, both for Marcus and the Stoics generally, was <a href="#heraclitus">Heraclitus</a>, the mysterious figure from Ephesus (in modern-day Turkey) whose Zenlike aphorisms were proverbial for their profundity and obscurity alike. Heraclitus’s philosophical system ascribed a central role to <em>logos</em> and to fire as the primordial element. Both elements were naturally congenial to the Stoics, and may well have influenced them. Heraclitus is mentioned in a handful of entries in the <em>Meditations</em> (<a href="#book4-46">4.46</a>, <a href="#book6-47">6.47</a>), but his doctrines can be traced in many others. Moreover, his concision and epigrammatic phrasing anticipate the kind of enigmatic apothegm we find in a number of entries:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The best revenge is not to be like that. (<a href="#book6-6">6.6</a>)</p>
        <p>Straight, not straightened. (<a href="#book7-12">7.12</a>)</p>
        <p>The fencer’s weapon is picked up and put down again. The boxer’s is part of him. (<a href="#book12-9">12.9</a>)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It is from <a href="#heraclitus">Heraclitus</a> that Marcus derives one of his most memorable motifs, that of the unstable flux of time and matter in which we move. “We cannot step twice into the same river,” Heraclitus had said, and we see Marcus expanding on the observation: “Time is a river, a violent current of events, glimpsed once and already carried past us, and another follows and is gone” (<a href="#book4-43">4.43</a>; and compare <a href="#book2-17">2.17</a>, <a href="#book6-15">6.15</a>).</p>
      <p>Though <a href="#heraclitus">Heraclitus</a> was clearly the pre-Socratic who most influenced Marcus, other thinkers leave traces as well. Marcus twice borrows the poet <a href="#empedocles">Empedocles</a>’ image of the self-contained soul as a perfect sphere (<a href="#book8-41">8.41</a>, <a href="#book12-3">12.3</a>), and he alludes once to the mystic doctrines of the Pythagoreans (<a href="#book11-27">11.27</a>). Several entries explore the implications of phrases attributed to <a href="#democritus">Democritus</a>, one of the inventors of the theory of atoms, which would later inspire the <a href="#epicurus">Hellenistic philosopher Epicurus</a>.</p>
      <p>Neither <a href="#heraclitus">Heraclitus</a> nor <a href="#socrates">Socrates</a> had founded a school. That was an achievement reserved for <a href="#plato">Plato</a>, and then for Plato’s student Aristotle, who broke from his master to found the Peripatetic movement. Marcus never refers to Aristotle, though he does quote approvingly from the latter’s successor <a href="#theophrastus">Theophrastus</a> (<a href="#book2-10">2.10</a>). Probably more important was another fourth-century <abbr title="before Christ">B.C.</abbr> movement: Cynicism. The Cynics, of whom the first and most notorious was the irascible <a href="#diogenes">Diogenes of Sinope</a>, were united less by doctrine than by a common attitude, namely their contempt for societal institutions and a desire for a life more in accord with nature. Diogenes himself was largely responsible for the image of a philosopher as an impoverished ascetic (the “philosopher without clothes” evoked by Marcus at <em>Meditations</em> <a href="#book4-30">4.30</a> might well be a Cynic). His famous claim to be a “citizen of the world” surely anticipates, if it did not actually influence, the Stoic conception of the world as a city-state. Marcus refers to Diogenes in several passages, as well as to the latter’s student Monimus (<a href="#book2-15">2.15</a>), and invokes another Cynic, Crates, at <em>Meditations</em> <a href="#book6-13">6.13</a>, in an anecdote whose tenor is now uncertain.</p>
      <p>Marcus’s relationship to Epicureanism, Stoicism’s great rival among Hellenistic philosophical systems, is much more vexed. The followers of <a href="#epicurus">Epicurus</a> (341–270 <abbr title="before Christ">B.C.</abbr>) believed in a universe radically unlike that posited by Zeno and <a href="#chrysippus">Chrysippus</a>. The Stoic world is ordered to the nth degree; the Epicurean universe is random, the product of the haphazard conjunctions of billions of atoms. To speak of Providence in such a world is transparently absurd, and while Epicurus acknowledged the existence of gods, he denied that they took any interest in human life. As for humans, our role is simply to live as best we can, making the most of what pleasures are available to us and insulating ourselves as far as possible from pain and anxiety. In particular, we are to feel no anxiety about death, which consists simply in the dissolution of our component atoms. This process is not only inevitable, but harmless, for the simple reason that after death there is no “us” to suffer harm.</p>
      <p>Although the sect numbered not a few prominent Romans among its adherents, it never attained the success of Stoicism, and was regarded with genial contempt by most outsiders. The quietism endorsed by the Epicureans was obviously difficult to reconcile with an active public life&mdash;an important Roman value&mdash;and the Epicurean equation of the good with pleasure was bound to raise eyebrows among conservative Romans. “Eat, drink and be merry” was popularly supposed to be the Epicureans’ motto, though <a href="#epicurus">Epicurus</a> himself had been quite explicit in identifying pleasure with intellectual contemplation rather than the vulgar enjoyment of food and sex. Though a minority view, Epicureanism was, nonetheless, the only potential rival to Stoicism in offering a systematic cosmology, as Marcus acknowledges on a number of occasions by the stark dichotomy “Providence or atoms” (<a href="#book4-3">4.3</a>, <a href="#book10-6">10.6</a>, <a href="#book11-18">11.18</a>, <a href="#book12-14">12.14</a>).</p>
      <p>Marcus normally seems to view Epicureanism with disapproval (as we would expect). In <em>Meditations</em> <a href="#book6-10">6.10</a> he contrasts the Epicurean universe, founded on “mixture, interaction, dispersal” with the components of the Stoic system: “unity, order, design”&mdash;clearly to the advantage of the latter. Should we not be ashamed to fear death, he asks in another entry, when “even” the Epicureans disdain it? (<a href="#book12-34">12.34</a>). But other entries suggest a less dismissive attitude. Marcus quotes with apparent approval <a href="#epicurus">Epicurus’s</a> account of his own exemplary conduct during an illness (<a href="#book9-41">9.41</a>) and twice seeks comfort in the philosopher’s remarks on the endurance of pain (<a href="#book7-33">7.33</a>, <a href="#book7-64">7.64</a>). Like other late Stoics (Seneca is a notable example), he was willing to accept truth wherever he found it.</p>
      <p>Thus far we have been concerned with the content of the <em>Meditations</em>: the ethical doctrine of late Stoicism, incorporating a certain amount of Platonic and Heraclitean material, and overlaid with occasional reference to other schools and thinkers. But what of the <em>Meditations</em> itself? How and why was it written? Who is its audience? What kind of book is it? For the answers to these questions we must turn from the book’s content to its form and origins.</p>
      <h3 id="the-meditations-genre-structure-and-style"><a href="#the-meditations-genre-structure-and-style">&#35;</a> The <em>Meditations</em>: Genre, Structure, and Style <a href="#header" title="Back to top">&uarr;</a></h3>
      <p>I suspect that Marcus would have been surprised (and perhaps rather dismayed) to find himself enshrined in the Modern Library of the World’s Best Books. He would have been surprised, to begin with, by the title of the work ascribed to him. The long-established English title <em>Meditations</em> is not only not original, but positively misleading, lending a spurious air of resonance and authority quite alien to the haphazard set of notes that constitute the book. In the lost Greek manuscript used for the first printed edition&mdash;itself many generations removed from Marcus’s original&mdash;the work was entitled “To Himself” (Eis heauton). This is no more likely than <em>Meditations</em> to be the original title, though it is at least a somewhat more accurate description of the work.<sup><a href="#in6" id="in6-ref">6</a></sup></p>
      <p>In fact, it seems unlikely that Marcus himself gave the work any title at all, for the simple reason that he did not think of it as an organic whole in the first place. Not only was it not written for publication, but Marcus clearly had no expectation that anyone but himself would ever read it. The entries include a number of cryptic references to persons or events that an ancient reader would have found as unintelligible as we do. While a contemporary might have recognized some of the figures mentioned in <em>Meditations</em> <a href="#book8-25">8.25</a> or <a href="#book12-27">12.27</a>, for example, no ancient reader could have known what was in the letter that Rusticus wrote from Sinuessa (<a href="#book1-7">1.7</a>), what Antoninus said to the customs agent at Tusculum (<a href="#book1-16">1.16</a>), or what happened to Marcus at Caieta (<a href="#book1-17">1.17</a>). Elsewhere Marcus reflects directly on his role as emperor, in terms that would be quite irrelevant to anyone else. We find him worrying about the dangers of becoming “imperialized” (<a href="#book6-30">6.30</a>), reminding himself to speak simply in the Senate (<a href="#book8-30">8.30</a>), and reflecting on the unique position he occupies (<a href="#book11-7">11.7</a>). From these entries and others it seems clear that the “you” of the text is not a generic “you,” but the emperor himself. “When you look at yourself, see any of the emperors” (<a href="#book10-31">10.31</a>).</p>
      <p>How are we to categorize the <em>Meditations</em>? It is not a diary, at least in the conventional sense. The entries contain little or nothing related to Marcus’s day-to-day life: few names, no dates and, with two exceptions, no places. It also lacks the sense of audience&mdash;the reader over one’s shoulder&mdash;that tends to characterize even the most secretive diarist. Some scholars have seen it as the basis for an unwritten larger treatise, like Pascal’s <em>Pensées</em> or the notebooks of Joseph Joubert. Yet the notes are too repetitive and, in a philosophical sense, too elementary for that. The entries perhaps bear a somewhat closer resemblance to the working notes of a practicing philosopher: Wittgenstein’s <em>Zettel</em>, say, or the <em>Cahiers</em> of Simone Weil. Yet here, too, there is a significant difference. The <em>Meditations</em> is not tentative and exploratory, like the notes of Wittgenstein or Weil, and it contains little or nothing that is original. It suggests not a mind recording new perceptions or experimenting with new arguments, but one obsessively repeating and reframing ideas long familiar but imperfectly absorbed.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the best description of the entries is that suggested by the French scholar Pierre Hadot. They are “spiritual exercises” composed to provide a momentary stay against the stress and confusion of everyday life: a self-help book in the most literal sense. A revealing comment in this context is <em>Meditations</em> <a href="#book5-9">5.9</a>, where Marcus reminds himself “not to think of philosophy as your instructor, but as the sponge and egg white that relieve ophthalmia&mdash;as a soothing ointment.” On this reading, the individual entries were composed not as a record of Marcus’s thoughts or to enlighten others, but for his own use, as a means of practicing and reinforcing his own philosophical convictions. Such an interpretation accounts for several aspects of the entries that would otherwise be puzzling. It explains the predominance of the imperative in the text; its purpose is not to describe or reflect (let alone to “meditate”), but to urge, direct, and exhort.<sup><a href="#in7" id="in7-ref">7</a></sup> And it explains also the repetitiveness that strikes any reader of the work almost immediately&mdash;the continual circling back to the same few problems. The entries do not present new answers or novel solutions to these problems, but only familiar answers reframed. It was precisely this process of reframing and reexpressing that Marcus found helpful.</p>
      <p>The recognition that the entries are as much process as product also accounts for the shapelessness and apparent disorder of the work. We do not know by whom or on what basis the individual books of the <em>Meditations</em> were arranged; the order may be chronological, or partly chronological, or wholly arbitrary. The arrangement of the individual entries may or may not be Marcus’s own, though its very randomness suggests that it goes back to the author (a later editor would have been tempted to group together thematically similar entries, and perhaps to tie up some of the more obvious loose ends). Nor can we always be sure where individual entries begin and end; in some cases this is a question Marcus himself might not have been able to answer.<sup><a href="#in8" id="in8-ref">8</a></sup></p>
      <p>A special position is occupied by <a href="#book1">Book 1</a>, which is distinguished from the rest of the work by its autobiographical nature and by the greater impression of conscious design and ordering apparent in it. It consists of seventeen entries in which Marcus reflects on what he learned from various individuals in his life, either directly or from their example (hence the title I have given the section here, “Debts and Lessons,” which has no warrant in the transmitted text). The entries roughly mirror the chronology of Marcus’s early life, from his older relatives to his teachers to his adopted father, Antoninus, and ultimately to the gods.<sup><a href="#in9" id="in9-ref">9</a></sup> This logical schema, as well as the increasing length of the entries, suggests deliberate arrangement, presumably by Marcus himself. If so, then this book, at least, was conceived as an organic whole. It may be among the latest portions of the text, if scholars are correct in thinking (as most do) that the short sketch of Antoninus Pius in <em>Meditations</em> <a href="#book6-30">6.30</a> was the starting point for the longer memoir in <a href="#book1-16">1.16</a>.</p>
      <p>Attempts to find organic unity in the remaining books or development from book to book are doomed to failure. Wherever one opens the <em>Meditations</em> (with the exception of <a href="#book1">Book 1</a>) we find the same voice, the same themes; Marcus’s thought does not change or develop noticeably from one book to another. Nor can any structure or unity be discerned within individual books. It seems most likely that the division between books is a purely physical one. The transmitted “books,” in other words, represent the individual papyrus rolls of Marcus’s original, or perhaps of a later copy. When one had been filled, another was begun.<sup><a href="#in10" id="in10-ref">10</a></sup></p>
      <p>If the books as a whole are homogenous, the individual entries show considerable formal variety. Some are developed short essays that make a single philosophical point; many of the entries in <a href="#book2">Books 2</a> and <a href="#book3">3</a> are of this type. Others are straightforward imperatives (“Take the shortest route &hellip;”) or aphorisms (“no one can keep you from living in harmony with yourself”). Sometimes Marcus will list a number of basic principles in catalogue format (“remember that &hellip; and that &hellip; and that &hellip;”). Elsewhere he puts forward an analogy, sometimes with the point of comparison left to be inferred. Thus human lives are like “many lumps of incense on the same altar” (<a href="#book4-15">4.15</a>) or like “a rock thrown in the air” (<a href="#book9-17">9.17</a>). In other cases the analogy will be made explicit: “Have you ever seen a severed hand or foot &hellip; ? That’s what we do to ourselves &hellip; when we rebel against what happens to us” (<a href="#book8-34">8.34</a>). Others present a kind of formal meditative exercise, as when Marcus instructs himself to imagine the age of Vespasian (<a href="#book4-32">4.32</a>) or Augustus’s court (<a href="#book8-31">8.31</a>) and then to compare the imagined scene with that of his own time. Portions of two books (<a href="#book7">7</a> and <a href="#book11">11</a>) consist simply of quotations. Some entries appear to be rough drafts for others; several of the raw quotations from tragedies in <a href="#book7">Book 7</a> are incorporated in the much more polished <em>Meditations</em> <a href="#book11-6">11.6</a>. The significance of some entries remains completely obscure. Few critics have known what to make of notes like “Character: dark, womanish, obstinate” (<a href="#book4-28">4.28</a>) or “They don’t realize how much is included in <em>stealing, sowing, buying &hellip;</em>” (<a href="#book3-15">3.15</a>).</p>
      <p>The entries also differ considerably in the degree of artistry they display. Some entries are little more than Marcus’s notes or reminders to himself&mdash;the philosophical equivalent of “Phone Dr. re appt. Tues.?” But others are highly literary. Marcus wrote as a man trained in the rhetorical techniques of the second century. His thoughts naturally took on the impress of his training and intellectual milieu even when he was writing for himself alone.</p>
      <p>The shorter entries often display an interest in wordplay and a striving for epigrammatic brevity that recalls both the ingenuity of the rhetorical schools and the paradoxical compression of <a href="#heraclitus">Heraclitus</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Does the sun try to do the rain’s work? Or <a href="#asclepius">Asclepius</a> <a href="#demeter">Demeter’s</a>? (<a href="#book6-43">6.43</a>)</p>
        <p>Evil: the same old thing. (<a href="#book7-1">7.1</a>)</p>
        <p>Not a dancer but a wrestler &hellip; (<a href="#book7-61">7.61</a>)</p>
        <p>To accept it without arrogance, to let it go with indifference. (<a href="#book8-33">8.33</a>)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The philosophical tradition may have been influential on another element that we find occasionally: the intermittent snatches of dialogue or quasi-dialogue. As a developed form, the philosophical dialogue goes back to <a href="#plato">Plato</a>, who was imitated by later philosophers, notably Aristotle (in his lost works) and Cicero. The <em>Meditations</em> certainly does not contain the kind of elaborate scene setting that we expect in a true dialogue, but we do find in a number of entries a kind of internal debate in which the questions or objections of an imaginary interlocutor are answered by a second, calmer voice which corrects or rebukes its errors. The first voice seems to represent Marcus’s weaker, human side; the second is the voice of philosophy.</p>
      <p>The longer entries (none, of course, are very long) are marked by a coherent if sometimes slightly labored style. Not all critics have had kind words for Marcus’s expository prose, and some have been inclined to attribute perceived shortcomings to deficiencies in his Greek. But in all likelihood the occasional awkwardness is due less to an imperfect grasp of the language than to roughness of composition&mdash;Marcus thinking aloud or groping for an idea. The same explanation may underlie one of the most noticeable features of Marcus’s prose&mdash;namely, his tendency to string together pairs of near-synonymous words and phrases, as if uncertain whether he has hit the target the first time. When combined with the very abstract vocabulary natural in philosophical prose, this can make for difficult reading, especially in English, which privileges concision and concrete vocabulary to a greater degree than Greek. At its best, however, Marcus’s writing can be extraordinarily effective, most of all when it strikes a balance between image and idea, as in the opening of <a href="#book5-23">5.23</a>:</p>
      <blockquote><p>Keep in mind how fast things pass by and are gone&mdash;those that are now, and those to come. Existence flows past us like a river: the “what” is in constant flux, the “why” has a thousand variations. Nothing is stable, not even what’s right here. The infinity of past and future gapes before us&mdash;a chasm whose depths we cannot see.</p></blockquote>
      <p>This particular topic&mdash;the transience of human life, the constant change that shapes and informs the world&mdash;is a recurrent theme in the <em>Meditations</em>, and as we shall see, it is one whose treatment owes as much to literary as to philosophical models, and as much to Marcus’s own character as to Stoic doctrine.</p>
      <h3 id="recurring-themes"><a href="#recurring-themes">&#35;</a> Recurring Themes <a href="#header" title="Back to top">&uarr;</a></h3>
      <p>To try to extract a sustained and coherent argument from the <em>Meditations</em> as a whole would be an unprofitable exercise. It is simply not that kind of work. It would be equally fruitless to try to read autobiographical elements into individual entries (to take <a href="#book9-42">9.42</a> as referring to the revolt of Avidius Cassius, for example, or <a href="#book10-4">10.4</a> as a reflection on Commodus)&mdash;all the more so since so few of the entries can be dated with any security. This is not to say that the <em>Meditations</em> has no unity or no relationship to Marcus’s own life, for it has both. What unifies it is the recurrence of a small number of themes that surely reflect Marcus’s own preoccupations. It is the points to which Marcus returns most often that offer the best insight into his character and concerns.</p>
      <p>One example that will strike almost any reader is the sense of mortality that pervades the work. Death is not to be feared, Marcus continually reminds himself. It is a natural process, part of the continual change that forms the world. At other points it is the ultimate consolation. “Soon you will be dead,” Marcus tells himself on a number of occasions, “and none of it will matter” (cf. <a href="#book4-6">4.6</a>, <a href="#book7-22">7.22</a>, <a href="#book8-2">8.2</a>). The emphasis on the vanity and worthlessness of earthly concerns is here linked to the more general idea of transience. All things change or pass away, perish and are forgotten. This is the burden of several of the thought exercises that Marcus sets himself: to think of the court of Augustus (<a href="#book8-31">8.31</a>), of the age of Vespasian or Trajan (<a href="#book4-32">4.32</a>), the great philosophers and thinkers of the past (<a href="#book6-47">6.47</a>)&mdash;all now dust and ashes.</p>
      <p>This theme is not specific to Stoicism. We meet it at every turn in ancient literature. Marcus himself quotes the famous passage in <a href="#book6">Book 6</a> of Homer’s Iliad in which the lives of mortals are compared to leaves that grow in the spring, flourish for a season and then fall and die, to be replaced by others (10.34). He would have recognized the sentiment in other writers too, from the melancholy Greek lyric poet Mimnermus, who develops and expands on Homer’s simile, to the Roman lawyer Servius Sulpicius, writing to his friend Cicero on the death of the latter’s daughter:</p>
      <blockquote><p>I want to share with you something that brought me not a little consolation, in hopes that it might have the same effect on you. On my way back from Asia, on the voyage from Aegina to Megara, I gazed at the lands we passed. Aegina was behind me, Megara before me, Piraeus on the starboard side, Corinth to port&mdash;towns which flourished once upon a time, and now lie fallen and in ruins before our eyes&mdash;and I said to myself, “Alas! &hellip; and will you, Servius, not restrain your grief and recall that you were born a mortal?” Believe me, the thought was no small consolation to me.</p></blockquote>
      <p>This is not a point modern grief counselors would be inclined to dwell on, but it is one that Marcus would have understood perfectly, and its appeal to him casts light on both his character and his background. Marcus may have been a Stoic, but he was also a Roman, influenced not only by Zeno and <a href="#chrysippus">Chrysippus</a> but by Homer and Vergil. Vergil is nowhere mentioned in the <em>Meditations</em>, and in a Greek work could hardly be quoted or alluded to, but there is a note of melancholy that runs through the work that one can only call Vergilian.</p>
      <p>Other concerns surface as well. A number of entries discuss methods of dealing with pain or bodily weakness of other sorts. “When you have trouble getting out of bed &hellip;” begin several entries (<a href="#book5-1">5.1</a>, <a href="#book8-12">8.12</a>). A persistent motif is the need to restrain anger and irritation with other people, to put up with their incompetence or malice, to show them the errors of their ways. Several entries focus on the frustrations of life at court, nowhere more present than when Marcus tells himself to stop complaining about them (<a href="#book8-9">8.9</a>). He contrasts the court against philosophy as a stepmother against a mother&mdash;to be visited out of duty, but not someone we can really love (<a href="#book6-12">6.12</a>). Yet the court need not be an obstacle: it can be a challenge, even an opportunity. One can lead a good life anywhere, even at court, as Antoninus showed (<a href="#book5-16">5.16</a>, <a href="#book1-16">1.16</a>). “No role [is] so well suited to philosophy,” Marcus tells himself, “as the one you happen to be in right now” (<a href="#book11-7">11.7</a>).</p>
      <p>A more subtle clue to Marcus’s personality is the imagery that he prefers. It is worth noting, for example, how many images of nature occur in the <em>Meditations</em>. Many readers have been struck by <em>Meditations</em> <a href="#book3-2">3.2</a>, with its evocation of “nature’s inadvertence” in baking bread or ripening figs, olives, and stalks of wheat. Metaphors and offhand comparisons in other entries evoke the pastoral and agricultural rhythms of the Mediterranean world, with its flocks, herds, and vines, its seasons of sowing and harvesting, its grapes drying slowly into raisins. Some of these may be stock examples, but even a stock example can be revealing. One can hardly read a page of <a href="#plato">Plato</a> without tripping over the helmsmen, doctors, shoemakers, and other craftsmen who populated ancient Athens; such figures are much rarer in Marcus. The image of society as a tree whose branches are individual human beings expresses an important Stoic principle, but the image is developed further than one might expect and informed by what might be personal observation: “You can see the difference between the branch that’s been there since the beginning, remaining on the tree and growing with it, and the one that’s been cut off and grafted back.”</p>
      <p>Affection for the natural world contrasts with a persistent sense of disgust and contempt for human life and other human beings&mdash;a sense that it is difficult to derive from (or even reconcile with) Stoicism. As P. A. Brunt puts it, “Reason told Marcus that the world was good beyond improvement, and yet it constantly appeared to him evil beyond remedy.” The courtiers who surround him are vain and obsequious, while the people he deals with on a daily basis are “meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly” (<a href="#book2-1">2.1</a>). One of the most frequently recurring points in the <em>Meditations</em> is the reminder that human beings are social animals, as if this was a point Marcus had a particularly hard time accepting. The gods care for mortals, he reminds himself, “and you&mdash;on the verge of death&mdash;you still refuse to care for them.”</p>
      <p>There is a persistent strain of pessimism in the work. “The things we want in life are empty, stale, and trivial. Dogs snarling at each other. Quarreling children&mdash;laughing and then bursting into tears a moment later. Trust, shame, justice, truth&mdash;‘gone from the earth and only found in heaven.’ Why are you still here?” (<a href="#book5-33">5.33</a>). Images of dirt appear in several entries. The world around us resembles the baths: “oil, sweat, dirt, grayish water, all of it disgusting” (<a href="#book8-24">8.24</a>). If Marcus contemplates the stars, he does so only in order to “wash off the mud of life below” (<a href="#book7-47">7.47</a>). And the objective analysis Marcus prizes often shades over into a depressing cynicism (in the modern sense of the term). “Disgust at what things are made of: Liquid, dust, bones, filth. Or marble as hardened dirt, gold and silver as residues, clothes as hair, purple dye as shellfish blood. And all the rest” (<a href="#book9-36">9.36</a>). The human body itself is no more than “rotting meat in a bag” (<a href="#book8-38">8.38</a>). “[D]espise your flesh. A mess of blood, pieces of bone, a woven tangle of nerves, veins, arteries” (<a href="#book2-2">2.2</a>). Perhaps the most depressing entry in the entire work is the one in which Marcus urges himself to cultivate an indifference to music (<a href="#book11-2">11.2</a>).</p>
      <p>As one scholar has observed, “reading the <em>Meditations</em> for long periods can be conducive of melancholy.” And even those who love the book cannot deny that there is something impoverishing about the view of human life it presents. Matthew Arnold, whose essay on the work reveals a deep respect and affection for Marcus, identified the central shortcoming of his philosophy as its failure to make any allowance for joy, and I think this is a fair criticism. Marcus does not offer us a means of achieving happiness, but only a means of resisting pain. The Stoicism of the <em>Meditations</em> is fundamentally a defensive philosophy; it is noteworthy how many military images recur, from references to the soul as being “posted” or “stationed” to the famous image of the mind as an invulnerable fortress (<a href="#book8-48">8.48</a>). Such images are not unique to Marcus, but one can imagine that they might have had special meaning for an emperor whose last years were spent in “<em>warfare and a journey far from home</em>” (<a href="#book2-17">2.17</a>). For Marcus, life was a battle, and often it must have seemed&mdash;what in some sense it must always be&mdash;a losing battle.</p>
      <p>There are also a handful of points in the text where we have glimpses of a different frame of mind, most obviously when Marcus refers to the gods. From a Stoic perspective, of course, “God” or “the gods” (the terms are used interchangeably by many ancient writers) are merely conventional terms for what we might equally well call “nature” or “the <em>logos</em>” or “Providence,” or simply “how things are.” Marcus stresses the benevolence of this power (what is divine must be good, surely?), but it is clear that he also ascribes to its actions the implacability with which orthodox Stoic doctrine endows it. It is not easy to see why one should pray to a power whose decisions one can hardly hope to influence, and indeed Marcus several times seems to admit the possibility that one should not (<a href="#book5-7">5.7</a>, <a href="#book6-44">6.44</a>, <a href="#book9-40">9.40</a>).</p>
      <p>It is all the more surprising, then, to find Marcus elsewhere suggesting a more personal concern on the gods’ part. The final entry of <a href="#book1">Book 1</a> is the most obvious example. Here Marcus indicates that the gods have aided him quite directly “through their gifts, their help, their inspiration,” just as they have others (cf. <a href="#book9-11">9.11</a>). Their help is curiously concrete. Among the things for which they are thanked are “remedies granted through dreams,” including “the one at Caieta” (<a href="#book1-17">1.17</a>; the text is uncertain). The gods also assist other people, he reminds himself, “just as they do you&mdash;by signs and dreams and every other way” (<a href="#book9-27">9.27</a>). That Marcus himself did believe deeply in the gods, not merely as a figure of speech but as a real force in his own life, is suggested by his refutation of those who doubt their existence: “I know the gods exist&hellip;.&mdash;from having felt their power, over and over” (<a href="#book12-28">12.28</a>). How was this personal relationship with the divine to be reconciled with the impersonal <em>logos</em> of the Stoics? The question seems to be played out in the dialogue at <em>Meditations</em> <a href="#book9-40">9.40</a>. “But those are things the gods left up to me,” protests one voice, to which another responds, “And what makes you think the gods don’t care about what’s up to us?” Marcus himself may not have fully recognized or acknowledged this conflict, but its existence may point to a half-conscious awareness that the answer Stoicism offered was not in every respect satisfactory.</p>

      <p>How or by whom the <em>Meditations</em> was preserved is unknown. The late-fourth-century <em>Historia Augusta</em> paints a picture of Marcus lecturing on the <em>Meditations</em> to a spellbound audience at Rome&mdash;one of the charming fantasies in which that peculiar work abounds, but certainly an invention. The passage does suggest, however, that the text was in circulation by the fourth century, when it is also mentioned by the orator Themistius. It was very likely familiar also to a contemporary of Themistius’s, the neo- pagan emperor Julian (known to later ages as Julian the Apostate), in whose dialogue “The Caesars” Marcus is pictured as a model for the kind of philosopher-king that Julian himself aspired to be.</p>
      <p>The century that followed Themistius and Julian was one of decline, at least in the West&mdash;decline in political institutions, and also in the knowledge of Greek. For the next thousand years Marcus’s work, like that of Homer and Euripides, would remain unknown to Western readers. Copies survived in the Greek-speaking East, of course, but even there the <em>Meditations</em> seems to have been little read. For centuries, all trace of it is lost, until at the beginning of the tenth century it reappears in a letter from the scholar and churchman Arethas, who writes to a friend, “I have had for a while now a copy of the Emperor Marcus’s invaluable book. It was not only old but practically coming apart&hellip;. I have had it copied and can now pass it on to posterity in better shape.” Whether Arethas’s copy was indeed responsible for the work’s survival we do not know. At any rate, its readership seems to have increased in the centuries that followed. It is quoted a generation or two later by the vast Byzantine encyclopedia known as the <em>Suda</em>, and it was perhaps around this period also that an unknown Byzantine poet composed a brief appreciation that came to be copied along with the text:</p>
      <h3 id="on-the-book-of-marcus"><a href="#on-the-book-of-marcus">&#35;</a> On the book of Marcus <a href="#header" title="Back to top">&uarr;</a></h3>
      <blockquote>

        And in it find abundantly<br>
        A knowledge of the things that are,<br>
        Those that have been, and those to come.<br><br>
        And know as well that joy and grief<br>
        Are nothing more than empty smoke.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453 led to an exodus of scholars, bringing with them the Greek texts that inspired the Italian Renaissance. The <em>Meditations</em> must have been among them. Yet even at this date the work’s survival hung by a thread. The only complete manuscript to survive is a fourteenth-century codex (now in the Vatican), which is riddled with errors. The first printed edition did not appear until 1559, when Wilhelm Holzmann (known as Xylander) produced a text from what seems to have been a more reliable manuscript. That manuscript, unfortunately, has not survived. But even at its best it was a very imperfect witness to what Marcus himself wrote. Our text of the <em>Meditations</em> contains a number of passages that are garbled or in which one or more crucial words seem to have been omitted. Some of these errors may be due to the confused state of Marcus’s original copy. Others may have been accidentally introduced in the course of the copying and recopying that the work underwent in the millennium following Marcus’s death. In some cases the informed guesswork of scholars over several centuries has been able to restore the original text. In others, there is still uncertainty.<sup><a href="#in11" id="in11-ref">11</a></sup></p>
      <p>The <em>Meditations</em> has never attracted great interest from professional students of the classics, and the reasons are perhaps understandable. It contains few direct references to historical events and provides relatively little material for social historians. As evidence for later Stoicism it pales beside the greater bulk of <a href="https://vreeman.com/discourses/">Epictetus’s <em>Discourses</em></a>. Yet it has always exerted a fascination on those outside the narrow orbit of classical study, perhaps especially on those who can best appreciate the pressures that Marcus himself faced. The <em>Meditations</em> was among the favorite reading of Frederick the Great; a recent American president has claimed to reread it every few years. But it has attracted others too, from poets like Pope, Goethe, and Arnold to the southern planter William Alexander Percy, who observed in his autobiography that “there is left to each of us, no matter how far defeat pierces, the unassailable wintry kingdom of Marcus Aurelius&hellip;. It is not outside, but within, and when all is lost, it stands fast.”<sup><a href="#in12" id="in12-ref">12</a></sup></p>
      <p>If Marcus has been studied less than many ancient authors, he has been translated more than most. But it has been a generation since his last English incarnation, and the time seems ripe for another attempt. My intention in what follows has been to represent in readable English both the content and the texture of the <em>Meditations</em>. I have been especially concerned to convey the patchwork character of the original, both the epigrammatic concision that characterizes some entries and the straggling discursiveness of others. I hope the results will bear out my conviction that what a Roman emperor wrote long ago for his own use can still be meaningful to those far removed from him in time and space. We do not live in Marcus’s world, but it is not as remote from us as we sometimes imagine. There could be no better witness to the effect of the <em>Meditations</em> on a modern reader than the Russian poet Joseph Brodsky, whose essay “Homage to Marcus Aurelius” takes its departure from the famous statue of the emperor on the Capitoline hill in Rome:</p>
      <blockquote><p>I saw him for the last time a few years ago, on a wet winter night, in the company of a stray Dalmatian. I was returning by taxi to my hotel after one of the most disastrous evenings in my entire life. The next morning I was leaving Rome for the States. I was drunk. The traffic moved with the speed one wishes for one’s funeral. At the foot of the Capitol I asked the driver to stop, paid, and got out of the car&hellip;. Presently I discovered I was not alone: a middle-sized Dalmatian appeared out of nowhere and quietly sat down a couple of feet away. Its sudden presence was so oddly comforting that momentarily I felt like offering it one of my cigarettes&hellip;. For a while we both stared at the horseman’s statue&hellip;. And suddenly&mdash;presumably because of the rain and the rhythmic pattern of Michelangelo’s pilasters and arches&mdash;all got blurred, and against that blur, the shining statue, devoid of any geometry, seemed to be moving. Not at great speed, and not out of this place; but enough for the Dalmatian to leave my side and follow the bronze progress.</p></blockquote>
      <h4 id="further-reading"><a href="#further-reading">&#35;</a> Further reading <a href="#header" title="Back to top">&uarr;</a></h4>
      <p>The standard modern biography of Marcus is A. R. Birley, <em>Marcus Aurelius</em> (1966; rev. ed., New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1987), which makes full use of the principal ancient literary sources&mdash;not only the <em>Meditations</em> (especially <a href="#book1">Book 1</a>), but the remains of the history of Dio Cassius, the letters of <a href="#fronto">Fronto</a> and the biography of Marcus in the so-called <em>Historia Augusta</em>. Birley also draws on recent research into the careers of upper-class officeholders (prosopography) and the workings of the imperial administration to paint a picture of Marcus’s background and the society he moved in.</p>
      <p>The most comprehensive and reliable treatment of the Antonine age can be found in the <em>Cambridge Ancient History</em>, volume XI, <em>The High Empire</em>, <abbr title="Anno Domini">A.D.</abbr> 70–192 (Cambridge University Press, 2000). Edward Gibbon’s famous characterization of the period in the opening chapters of his <em>History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em> remains well worth reading, although the picture it paints may be too rosy-colored. A useful counterbalance is E. R. Dodds, <em>Pagan and Christian in an Age of Anxiety</em> (Cambridge, Eng.: Cambridge University Press, 1965), which offers a very different assessment of the period.</p>
      <p>Treatments of special topics abound, and only a few titles can be mentioned. The upper-class education that Marcus enjoyed is described by S. F. Bonner, <em>Education in Ancient Rome</em> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1977). E. Champlin’s <em>Fronto and Antonine Rome</em> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1980) is the best modern study of Marcus’s teacher. Glen Bowersock’s <em>Greek Sophists in the Roman Empire</em> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1969) is a fundamental study of intellectual culture in the second century. Fergus Millar’s <em>The Emperor in the Roman World</em> (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1977) is an exhaustive analysis of the civil and administrative functions performed by Marcus and his fellow emperors, complemented for military matters by J. B. Campbell’s <em>The Emperor and the Roman Army</em> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984).</p>
      <p>Most of the major ancient sources for Marcus and his world are conveniently printed with facing-page English translations in the Loeb Classical Library. The valuable but highly unreliable life of Marcus in the <em>Historia Augusta</em> can be found in the three volumes of <em>Scriptores Historiae Augustae</em>, trans. D. Magie (1921–1932), as well as in A. Birley, trans., <em>Lives of the Later Caesars</em> (New York: Penguin, 1976). The Loeb series also includes the letters of <a href="#fronto">Fronto</a>, trans. C. R. Haines (2 volumes, 1919); and of the historian Dio Cassius, trans. E. Cary (9 volumes, 1914– 1927, of which the last two are relevant to Marcus). Although composed and collected a generation before Marcus’s birth, the <em>Letters of Pliny the Younger</em>, trans. Betty Radice (2 volumes, 1969), are a rich and illuminating source for upper-class society in the mid-empire. Insight into the intellectual life of the period can be gained from the <em>Attic Nights</em> of the antiquarian Aulus Gellius, trans. J. C. Rolfe (3 volumes, 1927), the works of the satirist Lucian, trans. A. M. Harmon, K. Kilburn and M. D. MacLeod (8 volumes, 1913– 1967), and Philostratus’s entertaining <em>Lives of the Sophists</em>, trans. W. C. Wright (1921). Finally, mention should be made of two modern novels set in the Antonine period, Walter Pater’s <em>Marius the Epicurean</em> (1885) and Marguerite Yourcenar’s <em>Memoirs of Hadrian</em> (1951). Neither should be mistaken for a primary source, but each is, in its different way, a masterpiece.</p>
      <p>Recent work on Hellenistic philosophy has done much to illuminate the philosophical background of the <em>Meditations</em>. A clear and helpful introduction to both Stoicism and Epicureanism can be found in A. A. Long, <em>Hellenistic Philosophy</em> (London: Duckworth, 1974); on a much larger scale is Keimpe Algra, Jonathan Barnes and Jaap Mansfeld, eds., <em>The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy</em> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999). On Stoicism see also F. H. Sandbach, <em>The Stoics</em> (London: Chatto and Windus, 1975), and J. Rist, <em>Stoic Philosophy</em> (Cambridge, Eng.: Cambridge University Press, 1969). The works of the two most important Stoics, Zeno and <a href="#chrysippus">Chrysippus</a>, are largely lost; their surviving fragments are translated in the first volume of A. A. Long and David Sedley, <em>The Hellenistic Philosophers</em> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1987), which also includes much material on Epicureanism. An important source for the history of both schools is Diogenes Laertius’s <em>Lives of the Philosophers</em>, trans. R. D. Hicks, in the Loeb series (2 volumes, 1925).<sup><a href="#in13" id="in13-ref">13</a></sup></p>
      <p>For Stoicism under the empire, the most important sources are the works of Seneca the Younger and Epictetus. The best introduction to Seneca is probably the <em>Letters to Lucilius</em>, of which a selection is available in <em>Letters from a Stoic</em>, trans. R. Campbell (New York: Penguin, 1969). <a href="https://vreeman.com/discourses/">Epictetus’s <em>Discourses</em></a> and <a href="https://vreeman.com/discourses/#enchiridion">the <em>Enchiridion</em></a> are available in the Loeb series in a translation by W. A. Oldfather (2 volumes, 1925). <a href="https://vreeman.com/discourses/#enchiridion">The <em>Enchiridion</em></a> has also been translated by T. W. Higginson (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1955).</p>
      <p>For the <em>Meditations</em> itself the indispensable resource (though long out of print and difficult to obtain) is A.S.L. Farquharson’s The <em>Meditations</em> of the Emperor Marcus Antoninus, 2 vols. (Oxford, Eng.: Oxford University Press, 1944). I have derived benefit from a number of earlier English translations, notably those of Farquharson (recently reprinted with a new introduction by R. B. Rutherford); George Long (1862); C. R. Haines (Loeb, 1916); G.M.A. Grube (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1963) and Maxwell Staniforth (New York: Penguin, 1964), as well as from W. Theiler’s German translation (Zurich: Artemis, 1951) and the French edition of <a href="#book1">Book 1</a> by Pierre Hadot (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1998). The best modern edition of the Greek text is that by J. Dalfen (2d ed., B. G. Teubner, 1987), though in vexed passages I have sometimes preferred different readings.</p>
      <p>Among scholarly studies of the <em>Meditations</em>, three in particular deserve mention. P. A. Brunt, “Marcus Aurelius in His <em>Meditations</em>,” <em>Journal of Roman Studies</em> 64 (1974): 1– 20, analyzes the themes that especially exercise Marcus. Pierre Hadot, <em>The Inner Citadel: The “>Meditations” of Marcus Aurelius</em>, trans. M. Chase (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1998), is a thoughtful reconstruction of Marcus’s philosophical system. R. B. Rutherford, <em>The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius: A Study</em> (Oxford, Eng.: Clarendon, 1989), is an excellent analysis from a more literary perspective, with good remarks also on Marcus’s relationship with the gods. Among the many appreciations by nonclassicists two deserve special mention: Matthew Arnold’s “Marcus Aurelius” (originally a review of Long’s translation) in his <em>Lectures and Essays in Criticism</em>, ed. R. H. Super (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1962), and Joseph Brodsky’s “Homage to Marcus Aurelius” in his collection <em>On Grief and Reason</em> (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1995).</p>

      <p>Karen Schwabach read through an initial draft of the translation and suggested numerous improvements, for which I am deeply grateful. For help of various sorts I am also indebted to Deborah DeMania, Gregory Gelburd, Krista Kane, Charles Mathewes, Katherine Odell, Hayden Pelliccia, Ellyn Schumacher, and Alphonse Vinh. My colleagues in the Department of Classics at the University of Virginia, and in particular my department chair, John Miller, made it possible for me to take course relief during the fall semester of 2001, when much of the work was completed. Thanks are due finally to my editor, Will Murphy, for his patience and enthusiasm for this project.</p>

      <ol>
        <li id="in1">In this larger sense, rather than attempting to translate it, I have generally left it simply as “(the) <em>logos</em>.” I hope that readers who have assimilated such terms as “karma” and “the Tao” will be prepared to welcome this one too. <a href="#in1-ref" class="return">⏎</a></li>
        <li id="in2">So, too, some modern physicists have imagined a series of universes produced by an alternation of expansions and contractions&mdash;“big bangs” and “big crunches.” <a href="#in2-ref" class="return">⏎</a></li>
        <li id="in3">Ramsay Macmullen, <em>Enemies of the Roman Order</em> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1966), p. 48. <a href="#in3-ref" class="return">⏎</a></li>
        <li id="in4">Earlier translators have been driven to clumsy equivalents such as “Guiding Reason.” I have generally rendered it “mind,” as being perhaps the least unsatisfactory English equivalent. <a href="#in4-ref" class="return">⏎</a></li>
        <li id="in5">Two examples are worth pointing to. Marcus finds the gladiatorial combat and the brutal executions of the arena a source of tedium (<a href="#book6-46">6.46</a>); that they might be morally wrong seems never to have occurred to him. He prides himself on not having taken sexual advantage of his slaves, not because it would have been harmful or unjust to them, but because such self-indulgence would have been damaging to his own character (<a href="#book1-17">1.17</a>). There is no sign that he ever questioned slavery as an institution. If asked, he would no doubt have responded that “true” slavery is the self-enslavement of the mind to emotion and desire (cf. <a href="#book8-3">8.3</a>, <a href="#book9-40">9.40</a>, <a href="#book11-30">11.30</a>); actual bodily slavery is merely a condition to be accepted and endured, like nearsightedness or a cold. <a href="#in5-ref" class="return">⏎</a></li>
        <li id="in6">A still better title might be “Memoranda,” which suggests both the miscellaneous character of the work and something about its intended function. Scores of entries begin with the injunctions to “remember &hellip;” or “keep in mind &hellip; ,” while the syntax of others (e.g., <a href="#book12-18">12.18</a>) presupposes such an admonition. <a href="#in6-ref" class="return">⏎</a></li>
        <li id="in7">In order to stress the self-directed nature of the <em>Meditations</em> I have sometimes preferred to translate these as resolutions (“to &hellip;”) rather than direct commands. <a href="#in7-ref" class="return">⏎</a></li>
        <li id="in8">The conventional divisions and numbering go back only to the Latin translation published by Thomas Gataker in 1652. It cannot be regarded as authoritative, and I have occasionally split up a single entry into two (sometimes following earlier editors, sometimes not). <a href="#in8-ref" class="return">⏎</a></li>
        <li id="in9">There are some striking omissions, which may or may not be significant. Antoninus’s predecessor, Hadrian, is not mentioned, for example. It may be that Marcus disapproved of him, or simply that he had little contact with him before his death in 138. Perhaps more surprising is the lack of any reference to Herodes Atticus, from whom Marcus learned Greek rhetoric. Does this point to personal tensions that arose between the two in later years? Or does the omission stem from Marcus’s move away from rhetoric toward philosophy? (It is noteworthy that the Latin rhetorician <a href="#fronto">Fronto</a>, with whom Marcus seems to have been close, is allotted only a very brief entry in comparison with Marcus’s philosophical preceptors.) <a href="#in9-ref" class="return">⏎</a></li>
        <li id="in10">The openings of <a href="#book2">Books 2</a> and <a href="#book3">3</a> differ from those that follow in including a brief note to identify (presumably) the place of composition. We do not know whether these notes go back to Marcus himself, or why the other books lack them. The average length of the entries in these two books is perhaps slightly longer than in the later books, but there are few differences otherwise. Attempts to find a thematic thread within <a href="#book2">Books 2</a> and <a href="#book3">3</a> as a whole are not convincing. <a href="#in10-ref" class="return">⏎</a></li>
        <li id="in11">I have noted the most egregious instances in the notes, and have marked with an obelus (&lt; &hellip; &gt;) a few passages where the original is impossible to reconstruct. <a href="#in11-ref" class="return">⏎</a></li>
        <li id="in12">William Alexander Percy, <em>Lanterns on the Levee</em> (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1973), p. 313. <a href="#in12-ref" class="return">⏎</a></li>
        <li id="in13">A survey of work on the predecessors and rivals of the Stoics is obviously beyond the scope of this note, but two good starting points may be mentioned. The surviving fragments of <a href="#heraclitus">Heraclitus</a> and other early philosophers who appear in the <em>Meditations</em> are translated in Kathleen Freeman, <em>Ancilla to the Presocratic Philosophers</em> (Oxford: Blackwell, 1948 and later reprints). Any reader unfamiliar with <a href="#plato">Plato</a> should probably begin with the <em>Apology of <a href="#socrates">Socrates</a></em>, available in the Modern Library’s <em>Selected Dialogues of Plato</em>, trans. B. Jowett, rev. H. Pelliccia (New York: Random House, 2000) or any number of other translations. <a href="#in13-ref" class="return">⏎</a></li>

      <p>And from him as well, to be steady and consistent in valuing philosophy.</p>
      <p>And to help others and be eager to share, not to be a pessimist, and never to doubt your friends’ affection for you. And that when people incurred his disapproval, they always knew it. And that his friends never had to speculate about his attitude to anything: it was always clear.</p>
      <h3 id="book1-15"><a href="#book1-15">&#35;</a> 15. Maximus <sup><a href="#maximus">i</a></sup></h3>

      <p>Other people’s certainty that what he said was what he thought, and what he did was done without malice.</p>
      <p>Never taken aback or apprehensive. Neither rash nor hesitant&mdash;or bewildered, or at a loss. Not obsequious&mdash;but not aggressive or paranoid either.</p>
      <p>Generosity, charity, honesty.</p>
      <p>The sense he gave of <em>staying</em> on the path rather than being <em>kept</em> on it.</p>
      <p>That no one could ever have felt patronized by him&mdash;or in a position to patronize him.</p>
      <p>A sense of humor.</p>
      <h3 id="book1-16"><a href="#book1-16">&#35;</a> 16. My adopted father <sup><a href="#antoninus">i</a></sup></h3>
      <p>Compassion. Unwavering adherence to decisions, once he’d reached them. Indifference to superficial honors. Hard work. Persistence.</p>
      <p>Listening to anyone who could contribute to the public good.</p>
      <p>His dogged determination to treat people as they deserved. A sense of when to push and when to back off.</p>
      <p>Putting a stop to the pursuit of boys.</p>
      <p>His altruism. Not expecting his friends to keep him entertained at dinner or to travel with him (unless they wanted to). And anyone who had to stay behind to take care of something always found him the same when he returned.</p>
      <p>His searching questions at meetings. A kind of single-mindedness, almost, never content with first impressions, or breaking off the discussion prematurely.</p>
      <p>His constancy to friends&mdash;never getting fed up with them, or playing favorites.</p>
      <p>Self-reliance, always. And cheerfulness.</p>
      <p>And his advance planning (well in advance) and his discreet attention to even minor things.</p>
      <p>His restrictions on acclamations&mdash;and all attempts to flatter him.</p>
      <p>His constant devotion to the empire’s needs. His stewardship of the treasury. His willingness to take responsibility&mdash;and blame&mdash;for both.</p>
      <p>His attitude to the gods: no superstitiousness. And his attitude to men: no demagoguery, no currying favor, no pandering. Always sober, always steady, and never vulgar or a prey to fads.</p>
      <p>The way he handled the material comforts that fortune had supplied him in such abundance&mdash;without arrogance and without apology. If they were there, he took advantage of them. If not, he didn’t miss them.</p>
      <p>No one ever called him glib, or shameless, or pedantic. They saw him for what he was: a man tested by life, accomplished, unswayed by flattery, qualified to govern both himself and them.</p>
      <p>His respect for people who practiced philosophy&mdash;at least, those who were sincere about it. But without denigrating the others&mdash;or listening to them.</p>
      <p>His ability to feel at ease with people&mdash;and put them at <em>their</em> ease, without being pushy.</p>
      <p>His willingness to take adequate care of himself. Not a hypochondriac or obsessed with his appearance, but not ignoring things either. With the result that he hardly ever needed medical attention, or drugs or any sort of salve or ointment.</p>
      <p>This, in particular: his willingness to yield the floor to experts&mdash;in oratory, law, psychology, whatever&mdash;and to support them energetically, so that each of them could fulfill his potential.</p>
      <p>That he respected tradition without needing to constantly congratulate himself for Safeguarding Our Traditional Values.</p>
      <p>Not prone to go off on tangents, or pulled in all directions, but sticking with the same old places and the same old things.</p>
      <p>The way he could have one of his migraines and then go right back to what he was doing&mdash;fresh and at the top of his game.</p>
      <p>That he had so few secrets&mdash;only state secrets, in fact, and not all that many of those.</p>
      <p>The way he kept public actions within reasonable bounds&mdash;games, building projects, distributions of money and so on&mdash;because he looked to what needed doing and not the credit to be gained from doing it.</p>
      <p>No bathing at strange hours, no self-indulgent building projects, no concern for food, or the cut and color of his clothes, or having attractive slaves. (The robe from his farm at Lorium, most of the things at Lanuvium, the way he accepted the customs agent’s apology at Tusculum, etc.)</p>
      <p>He never exhibited rudeness, lost control of himself, or turned violent. No one ever saw him sweat. Everything was to be approached logically and with due consideration, in a calm and orderly fashion but decisively, and with no loose ends.</p>
      <p>You could have said of him (as they say of <a href="#socrates">Socrates</a>) that he knew how to enjoy and abstain from things that most people find it hard to abstain from and all too easy to enjoy. Strength, perseverance, self-control in both areas: the mark of a soul in readiness&mdash;indomitable.</p>

      <h3 id="book1-17"><a href="#book1-17">&#35;</a> 17. The gods</h3>
      <p>That I had good grandparents, a good mother and father, a good sister, good teachers, good servants, relatives, friends&mdash;almost without exception. And that I never lost control of myself with any of them, although I had it in me to do that, and I might have, easily. But thanks to the gods, I was never put in that position, and so escaped the test.</p>
      <p>That I wasn’t raised by my grandfather’s girlfriend for longer than I was. That I didn’t lose my virginity too early, and didn’t enter adulthood until it was time&mdash;put it off, even.</p>
      <p>That I had someone&mdash;as a ruler and as a father&mdash;who could keep me from being arrogant and make me realize that even at court you can live without a troop of bodyguards, and gorgeous clothes, lamps, sculpture&mdash;the whole charade. That you can behave almost like an ordinary person without seeming slovenly or careless as a ruler or when carrying out official obligations.</p>
      <p>That I had the kind of brother I did. One whose character challenged me to improve my own. One whose love and affection enriched my life.</p>
      <p>That my children weren’t born stupid or physically deformed.</p>
      <p>That I wasn’t more talented in rhetoric or poetry, or other areas. If I’d felt that I was making better progress I might never have given them up.</p>
      <p>That I conferred on the people who brought me up the honors they seemed to want early on, instead of putting them off (since they were still young) with the hope that I’d do it later.</p>
      <p>That I knew <a href="#apollonius">Apollonius</a>, and <a href="#rusticus">Rusticus</a>, and <a href="#maximus">Maximus</a>.</p>
      <p>That I was shown clearly and often what it would be like to live as nature requires. The gods did all they could&mdash;through their gifts, their help, their inspiration&mdash;to ensure that I could live as nature demands. And if I’ve failed, it’s no one’s fault but mine. Because I didn’t pay attention to what they told me&mdash;to what they taught me, practically, step by step.</p>
      <p>That my body has held out, especially considering the life I’ve led.</p>
      <p>That I never laid a finger on <a href="#benedicta">Benedicta</a> or on <a href="#theodotus">Theodotus</a>. And that even later, when I was overcome by passion, I recovered from it.</p>
      <p>That even though I was often upset with <a href="#rusticus">Rusticus</a> I never did anything I would have regretted later.</p>
      <p>That even though she died young, at least my mother spent her last years with me.</p>
      <p>That whenever I felt like helping someone who was short of money, or otherwise in need, I never had to be told that I had no resources to do it with. And that I was never put in that position myself&mdash;of having to take something from someone else.</p>
      <p>That I have the wife I do: obedient, loving, humble.</p>
      <p>That my children had competent teachers.</p>
      <p>Remedies granted through dreams&mdash;when I was coughing blood, for instance, and having fits of dizziness. And the one at Caieta.</p>
      <p>That when I became interested in philosophy I didn’t fall into the hands of charlatans, and didn’t get bogged down in writing treatises, or become absorbed by logic-chopping, or preoccupied with physics.</p>
      <p>All things for which “we need the help of fortune and the gods.”</p>

And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him.

Let that determine what you do and say and think.</mark> If the gods exist, then to abandon human beings is not frightening; the gods would never subject you to harm. And if they don’t exist, or don’t care what happens to us, what would be the point of living in a world without gods or Providence? But they do exist, they do care what happens to us, and everything a person needs to avoid real harm they have placed within him. If there were anything harmful on the other side of death, they would have made sure that the ability to avoid it was within you. If it doesn’t harm your character, how can it harm your life? Nature would not have overlooked such dangers through failing to recognize them, or because it saw them but was powerless to prevent or correct them. Nor would it ever, through inability or incompetence, make such a mistake as to let good and bad things happen indiscriminately to good and bad alike. But death and life, success and failure, pain and pleasure, wealth and poverty, all these happen to good and bad alike, and they are neither noble nor shameful&mdash;and hence neither good nor bad.</p>

To understand those things&mdash;how stupid, contemptible, grimy, decaying, and dead they are&mdash;that’s what our intellectual powers are for. And to understand what those people really amount to, whose opinions and voices constitute fame. And what dying is&mdash;and that if you look at it in the abstract and break down your imaginary ideas of it by logical analysis, you realize that it’s nothing but a process of nature, which only children can be afraid of. (And not only a process of nature but a necessary one.) And how man grasps God, with what part of himself he does so, and how that part is conditioned when he does.</p>

To worship it is to keep it from being muddied with turmoil and becoming aimless and dissatisfied with nature&mdash;divine and human. What is divine deserves our respect because it is good; what is human deserves our affection because it is like us.

      <p>And other things. If you look at them in isolation there’s nothing beautiful about them, and yet by supplementing nature they enrich it and draw us in. And anyone with a feeling for nature&mdash;a deeper sensitivity&mdash;will find it all gives pleasure. Even what seems inadvertent. He’ll find the jaws of live animals as beautiful as painted ones or sculptures. He’ll look calmly at the distinct beauty of old age in men, women, and at the loveliness of children.

      <p>You need to avoid certain things in your train of thought: everything random, everything irrelevant. And certainly everything self-important or malicious. You need to get used to winnowing your thoughts, so that if someone says, “What are you thinking about?” you can respond at once (and truthfully) that you are thinking this or thinking that. And it would be obvious at once from your answer that your thoughts were straightforward and considerate ones&mdash;the thoughts of an unselfish person, one unconcerned with pleasure and with sensual indulgence generally, with squabbling, with slander and envy, or anything else you’d be ashamed to be caught thinking.</p>
      <p>Someone like that&mdash;someone who refuses to put off joining the elect&mdash;is a kind of priest, a servant of the gods, in touch with what is within him and what keeps a person undefiled by pleasures, invulnerable to any pain, untouched by arrogance, unaffected by meanness, an athlete in the greatest of all contests&mdash;the struggle not to be overwhelmed by anything that happens.

      <p>Cheerfulness. Without requiring other people’s help. Or serenity supplied by others.</p>
      <p>To stand up straight&mdash;not straightened.</p>
      <p><a href="#book3-6" class="return">&#35;</a> <strong id="book3-6">6.</strong> <mark title="The Daily Stoic: July 27th">If, at some point in your life, you should come across anything better than justice, honesty, self-control, courage&mdash;than a mind satisfied that it has succeeded in enabling you to act rationally, and satisfied to accept what’s beyond its control&mdash;if you find anything better than that, embrace it without reservations&mdash;it must be an extraordinary thing indeed&mdash;and enjoy it to the full.</mark></p>
      <p>But if nothing presents itself that’s superior to the spirit that lives within&mdash;the one that has subordinated individual desires to itself, that discriminates among impressions, that has broken free of physical temptations (as <a href="#socrates">Socrates</a> used to say), and subordinated itself to the gods, and looks out for human beings’ welfare&mdash;if you find that there’s nothing more important or valuable than that &hellip;</p>
      <p>&hellip; then don’t make room for anything but it&mdash;for anything that might lead you astray, tempt you off the road, and leave you unable to devote yourself completely to achieving the goodness that is uniquely yours. It would be wrong for anything to stand between you and attaining goodness&mdash;as a rational being and a citizen. Anything at all: the applause of the crowd, high office, wealth, or self-indulgence. All of them might seem to be compatible with it&mdash;for a while. But suddenly they control us and sweep us away.</p>
      <p>So make your choice straightforwardly, once and for all, and stick to it. Choose what’s best.</p>
      <p>&mdash;Best is what benefits <em>me</em>.</p>
      <p>As a rational being? Then follow through. Or just as an animal? Then say so and stand your ground without making a show of it. (Just make sure you’ve done your homework first.)</p>

If you can privilege your own mind, your guiding spirit and your reverence for its powers, that should keep you clear of dramatics, of wailing and gnashing of teeth. You won’t need solitude&mdash;or a cast of thousands, either. Above all, you’ll be free of fear and desire. And how long your body will contain the soul that inhabits it will cause you not a moment’s worry. If it’s time for you to go, leave willingly&mdash;as you would to accomplish anything that can be done with grace and honor. And concentrate on this, your whole life long: for your mind to be in the right state&mdash;the state a rational, civic mind should be in.</p>

The span we live is small&mdash;small as the corner of the earth in which we live it. Small as even the greatest renown, passed from mouth to mouth by short-lived stick figures, ignorant alike of themselves and those long dead.</p>
      <p><a href="#book3-11" class="return">&#35;</a> <strong id="book3-11">11.</strong> To the stand-bys above, add this one: always to define whatever it is we perceive&mdash;to trace its outline&mdash;so we can see what it really is: its substance. Stripped bare. As a whole. Unmodified. And to call it by its name&mdash;the thing itself and its components, to which it will eventually return. Nothing is so conducive to spiritual growth as this capacity for logical and accurate analysis of everything that happens to us. To look at it in such a way that we understand what need it fulfills, and in what kind of world. And its value to that world as a whole and to man in particular&mdash;as a citizen of that higher city, of which all other cities are mere households.</p>
      <p>What is it&mdash;this thing that now forces itself on my notice? What is it made up of? How long was it designed to last? And what qualities do I need to bring to bear on it&mdash;tranquillity, courage, honesty, trustworthiness, straightforwardness, independence or what?</p>
      <p>So in each case you need to say: “This is due to God.” Or: “This is due to the interweavings and intertwinings of fate, to coincidence or chance.” Or: “This is due to a human being. Someone of the same race, the same birth, the same society, but who doesn’t know what nature requires of him. But I do. And so I’ll treat them as the law that binds us&mdash;the law of nature&mdash;requires. With kindness and with justice.</p>
      <p>And in inconsequential things? I’ll do my best to treat them as they deserve.”</p>

      <p>Nowhere you can go is more peaceful&mdash;more free of interruptions&mdash;than your own soul. Especially if you have other things to rely on. An instant’s recollection and there it is: complete tranquillity. And by tranquillity I mean a kind of harmony.</p>
      <p>So keep getting away from it all&mdash;like that. Renew yourself. But keep it brief and basic. A quick visit should be enough to ward off all &lt; &hellip; &gt; and send you back ready to face what awaits you.</p>

      <p>Or are you complaining about the things the world assigns you? But consider the two options: Providence or atoms. And all the arguments for seeing the world as a city.</p>
      <p>Or is it your body? Keep in mind that when the mind detaches itself and realizes its own nature, it no longer has anything to do with ordinary life&mdash;the rough and the smooth, either one. And remember all you’ve been taught&mdash;and accepted&mdash;about pain and pleasure.</p>
      <p>Or is it your reputation that’s bothering you? But look at how soon we’re all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of all those applauding hands. The people who praise us&mdash;how capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all takes place. The whole earth a point in space&mdash;and most of it uninhabited. How many people there will be to admire you, and who they are.</p>
      <p>So keep this refuge in mind: the back roads of your self. Above all, no strain and no stress. Be straightforward. Look at things like a man, like a human being, like a citizen, like a mortal. And among the things you turn to, these two:</p>

      <p>That’s true. But you’re misunderstanding me. You’ll wind up like the people I mentioned before, misled by plausible reasoning. But if you make an effort to understand what I’m saying, then you won’t need to worry about neglecting your social duty.</p>
      <p><a href="#book5-7" class="return">&#35;</a> <strong id="book5-7">7.</strong> Prayer of the Athenians:</p>
      <blockquote><p><a href="#zeus">Zeus</a>, rain down, rain down<br>On the land and fields of Athens.</p></blockquote>
      <p>Either no prayers at all&mdash;or one as straightforward as that.</p>
      <p><a href="#book5-8" class="return">&#35;</a> <strong id="book5-8">8.</strong> <mark title="The Daily Stoic: November 3rd">Just as you overhear people saying that “the doctor prescribed such-and-such for him” (like riding, or cold baths, or walking barefoot &hellip;), say this: “Nature prescribed illness for him.” Or blindness. Or the loss of a limb. Or whatever. There “prescribed” means something like “ordered, so as to further his recovery.” And so too here. What happens to each of us is ordered. It furthers our destiny.</mark></p>
      <p>And when we describe things as “taking place,” we’re talking like builders, who say that blocks in a wall or a pyramid “take their place” in the structure, and fit together in a harmonious pattern.</p>
      <p>For there is a single harmony. Just as the world forms a single body comprising all bodies, so fate forms a single purpose, comprising all purposes. Even complete illiterates acknowledge it when they say that something “brought on” this or that. Brought on, yes. Or prescribed it. And in that case, let’s accept it&mdash;as we accept what the doctor prescribes. It may not always be pleasant, but we embrace it&mdash;because we want to get well. Look at the accomplishment of nature’s plans in that light&mdash;the way you look at your own health&mdash;and accept what happens (even if it seems hard to accept). Accept it because of what it leads to: the good health of the world, and the well-being and prosperity of <a href="#zeus">Zeus</a> himself, who would not have brought this on anyone unless it brought benefit to the world as a whole. No nature would do that&mdash;bring something about that wasn’t beneficial to what it governed.</p>
      <p>So there are two reasons to embrace what happens. One is that it’s happening to <em>you</em>. It was prescribed for you, and it pertains to you. The thread was spun long ago, by the oldest cause of all.</p>
      <p>The other reason is that what happens to an individual is a cause of well-being in what directs the world&mdash;of its well- being, its fulfillment, of its very existence, even. Because the whole is damaged if you cut away anything&mdash;anything at all&mdash;from its continuity and its coherence. Not only its parts, but its purposes. And that’s what you’re doing when you complain: hacking and destroying.</p>

In such deep darkness, such a sewer&mdash;in the flux of material, of time, of motion and things moved&mdash;I don’t know what there is to value or to work for.</p>
      <p>Quite the contrary. We need to comfort ourselves and wait for dissolution. And not get impatient in the meantime, but take refuge in these two things:</p>

      <p><mark title="The Daily Stoic: April 20th">Suppose you took certain things as touchstones of goodness: prudence, self-control, justice, and courage, say. If you understood “goods” as meaning those, you wouldn’t be able to follow that line about “so many goods&hellip;.” It wouldn’t make any sense to you. Whereas if you’d internalized the conventional meaning, you’d be able to follow it perfectly. You’d have no trouble seeing the author’s meaning and why it was funny.</mark></p>
      <p>Which shows that most people do acknowledge a distinction. Otherwise we wouldn’t recognize the first sense as jarring and reject it automatically, whereas we accept the second&mdash;the one referring to wealth and the benefits of celebrity and high living&mdash;as amusing and apropos.</p>
      <p>Now go a step further. Ask yourself whether we should accept as goods&mdash;and should value&mdash;the things we have to think of to have the line make sense&mdash;the ones whose abundance leaves their owner with “&hellip; no place to shit.”</p>

If any of them were proper to us, it would be improper to disdain or resist it. Nor would we admire people who show themselves immune to it. If the things themselves were good, it could hardly be good to give them up. But in reality the more we deny ourselves such things (and things like them)&mdash;or are deprived of them involuntarily, even&mdash;the better we become.</p>

Those admired by more advanced minds are held together by a living soul (flocks of sheep, herds of cows). Still more sophisticated people admire what is guided by a rational mind&mdash;not the universal mind, but one admired for its technical knowledge, or for some other skill&mdash;or just because it happens to own a lot of slaves.</p>
      <p>But those who revere that other mind&mdash;the one we all share, as humans and as citizens&mdash;aren’t interested in other things. Their focus is on the state of their own minds&mdash;to avoid all selfishness and illogic, and to work with others to achieve that goal.</p>

People who need those things are bound to be a mess&mdash;and bound to take out their frustrations on the gods.

      <p>To see the nature of a sunbeam, look at light as it falls through a narrow opening into a dark room. It extends in a straight line, striking any solid object that stands in its way and blocks the space beyond it. There it remains&mdash;not vanishing, or falling away.</p>
      <p>That’s what the outpouring&mdash;the diffusion&mdash;of thought should be like: not emptied out, but extended. And not striking at obstacles with fury and violence, or falling away before them, but holding its ground and illuminating what receives it.</p>

      <p><a href="#book9-1" class="return">&#35;</a> <strong id="book9-1">1.</strong> <mark title="The Daily Stoic: July 20th">Injustice is a kind of blasphemy. Nature designed rational beings for each other’s sake: to help&mdash;not harm&mdash;one another, as they deserve. To transgress its will, then, is to blaspheme against the oldest of the gods.</mark></p>
      <p>And to lie is to blaspheme against it too. Because “nature” means the nature of that which is. And that which is and that which is the case are closely linked, so that nature is synonymous with Truth&mdash;the source of all true things. To lie deliberately is to blaspheme&mdash;the liar commits deceit, and thus injustice. And likewise to lie without realizing it. Because the involuntary liar disrupts the harmony of nature&mdash;its order. He is in conflict with the way the world is structured. As anyone is who deviates toward what is opposed to the truth&mdash;even against his will. Nature gave him the resources to distinguish between true and false. And he neglected them, and now can’t tell the difference.</p>
      <p>And to pursue pleasure as good, and flee from pain as evil&mdash;that too is blasphemous. Someone who does that is bound to find himself constantly reproaching nature&mdash;complaining that it doesn’t treat the good and bad as they deserve, but often lets the bad enjoy pleasure and the things that produce it, and makes the good suffer pain, and the things that produce pain. And moreover, to fear pain is to fear something that’s bound to happen, the world being what it is&mdash;and that again is blasphemy. While if you pursue pleasure, you can hardly avoid wrongdoing&mdash;which is manifestly blasphemous.</p>
      <p>Some things nature is indifferent to; if it privileged one over the other it would hardly have created both. And if we want to follow nature, to be of one mind with it, we need to share its indifference. To privilege pleasure over pain&mdash;life over death, fame over anonymity&mdash;is clearly blasphemous. Nature certainly doesn’t.</p>
      <p>And when I say that nature is indifferent to them, I mean that they happen indifferently, at different times, to the things that exist and the things that come into being after them, through some ancient decree of Providence&mdash;the decree by which from some initial starting point it embarked on the creation that we know, by laying down the principles of what was to come and determining the generative forces: existence and change, and their successive stages.</p>
      <p><a href="#book9-2" class="return">&#35;</a> <strong id="book9-2">2.</strong> Real good luck would be to abandon life without ever encountering dishonesty, or hypocrisy, or self-indulgence, or pride. But the “next best voyage” is to die when you’ve had enough. Or are you determined to lie down with evil? Hasn’t experience even taught you <em>that</em>&mdash;to avoid it like the plague? Because it <em>is</em> a plague&mdash;a mental cancer&mdash;worse than anything caused by tainted air or an unhealthy climate. Diseases like that can only threaten your life; this one attacks your humanity.</p>
      <p><a href="#book9-3" class="return">&#35;</a> <strong id="book9-3">3.</strong> Don’t look down on death, but welcome it. It too is one of the things required by nature. Like youth and old age. Like growth and maturity. Like a new set of teeth, a beard, the first gray hair. Like sex and pregnancy and childbirth. Like all the other physical changes at each stage of life, our dissolution is no different.</p>
      <p>So this is how a thoughtful person should await death: not with indifference, not with impatience, not with disdain, but simply viewing it as one of the things that happen to us. Now you anticipate the child’s emergence from its mother’s womb; that’s how you should await the hour when your soul will emerge from its compartment.</p>
      <p>Or perhaps you need some tidy aphorism to tuck away in the back of your mind. Well, consider two things that should reconcile you to death: the nature of the things you’ll leave behind you, and the kind of people you’ll no longer be mixed up with. There’s no need to feel resentment toward them&mdash;in fact, you should look out for their well-being, and be gentle with them&mdash;but keep in mind that everything you believe is meaningless to those you leave behind. Because that’s all that could restrain us (if anything could)&mdash;the only thing that could make us want to stay here: the chance to live with those who share our vision. But now? Look how tiring it is&mdash;this cacophony we live in. Enough to make you say to death, “Come quickly. Before I start to forget myself, like them.”</p>

Just as all earthly creatures share one earth. Just as we all see by the same light, and breathe the same air&mdash;all of us who see and breathe.</p>
      <p><a href="#book9-9" class="return">&#35;</a> <strong id="book9-9">9.</strong> All things are drawn toward what is like them, if such a thing exists. All earthly things feel the earth’s tug. All wet things flow together. And airy things as well, so they have to be forcibly prevented from mixing. Fire is naturally drawn upward by that higher fire, but ready to ignite at the slightest touch of other, earthly flame. So that anything drier than usual makes good fuel, because less of what hinders combustion is mixed in with it.</p>
      <p>And things that share an intelligent nature are just as prone to seek out what is like them. If not more so. Because their superiority in other ways is matched by their greater readiness to mix and mingle with their counterparts.</p>
      <p>Even in irrational beings we see swarms and herds, and nesting, and love not unlike ours. Because they do have souls, and the bonding instinct is found in a developed form&mdash;not something we see in plants, or stones, or trees. And it’s still more developed in rational beings, with their states, friendships, families, groups, their treaties and truces. And in those yet more developed there is a kind of unity even between separate things, the kind that we see in the stars. An advanced level of development can produce a sympathy even in things that are quite distinct.</p>
      <p>But look how things are now. The rational things are the only ones that have lost that sense of attraction&mdash;of convergence. Only there do we not see that intermingling. But however much they try to avoid it, there’s no escaping. Nature is stronger. As you can see if you look closely.</p>

      <p>And when others stray off course, you can always try to set them straight, because every wrongdoer is doing something wrong&mdash;doing something <em>the wrong way</em>.</p>
      <p>And how does it injure you anyway? You’ll find that none of the people you’re upset about has done anything that could do damage to your mind. But that’s all that “harm” or “injury” could mean. Yes, boorish people do boorish things. What’s strange or unheard-of about that? Isn’t it yourself you should reproach&mdash;for not anticipating that they’d act this way? The <em>logos</em> gave you the means to see it&mdash;that a given person would act a given way&mdash;but you paid no attention. And now you’re astonished that he’s gone and done it. So when you call someone “untrustworthy” or “ungrateful,” turn the reproach on yourself. It was <em>you</em> who did wrong. By assuming that someone with those traits deserved your trust. Or by doing them a favor and expecting something in return, instead of looking to the action itself for your reward. What else did you expect from helping someone out? Isn’t it enough that you’ve done what your nature demands? You want a salary for it too? As if your eyes expected a reward for seeing, or your feet for walking. That’s what they were made for. By doing what they were designed to do, they’re performing their function. Whereas humans were made to help others. And when we do help others&mdash;or help them to do something&mdash;we’re doing what we were designed for. We perform our function.</p>

Know what an affectionate and loving disposition would feel like? Ever be fulfilled, ever stop desiring&mdash;lusting and longing for people and things to enjoy? Or for more time to enjoy them? Or for some other place or country&mdash;“a more temperate clime”? Or for people easier to get along with? And instead be satisfied with what you have, and accept the present&mdash;all of it. And convince yourself that everything is the gift of the gods, that things are good and always will be, whatever they decide and have in store for the preservation of that perfect entity&mdash;good and just and beautiful, creating all things, connecting and embracing them, and gathering in their separated fragments to create more like them.</p>
      <p>Will you ever take your stand as a fellow citizen with gods and human beings, blaming no one, deserving no one’s censure?</p>
      <p><a href="#book10-2" class="return">&#35;</a> <strong id="book10-2">2.</strong> Focus on what nature demands, as if you were governed by that alone. Then do that, and accept it, unless your nature as a living being would be degraded by it.</p>
      <p>Then focus on what <em>that</em> nature demands, and accept that too&mdash;unless your nature as a rational being would be degraded by it.</p>

      <p><a href="#book10-5" class="return">&#35;</a> <strong id="book10-5">5.</strong> Whatever happens to you has been waiting to happen since the beginning of time. The twining strands of fate wove both of them together: your own existence and the things that happen to you.</p>
      <p><a href="#book10-6" class="return">&#35;</a> <strong id="book10-6">6.</strong> Whether it’s atoms or nature, the first thing to be said is this: I am a part of a world controlled by nature. Secondly: that I have a relationship with other, similar parts. And with that in mind I have no right, as a part, to complain about what is assigned me by the whole. Because what benefits the whole can’t harm the parts, and the whole does nothing that doesn’t benefit it. That’s a trait shared by all natures, but the nature of the world is defined by a second characteristic as well: no outside force can compel it to cause itself harm.</p>
      <p>So by keeping in mind the whole I form a part of, I’ll accept whatever happens. And because of my relationship to other parts, I will do nothing selfish, but aim instead to join them, to direct my every action toward what benefits us all and to avoid what doesn’t. If I do all that, then my life should go smoothly. As you might expect a citizen’s life to go&mdash;one whose actions serve his fellow citizens, and who embraces the community’s decree.</p>
      <p><a href="#book10-7" class="return">&#35;</a> <strong id="book10-7">7.</strong> The whole is compounded by nature of individual parts, whose destruction is inevitable (“destruction” here meaning transformation). If the process is harmful to the parts and unavoidable, then it’s hard to see how the whole can run smoothly, with parts of it passing from one state to another, all of them built only to be destroyed in different ways. Does nature set out to cause its own components harm, and make them vulnerable to it&mdash;indeed, predestined to it? Or is it oblivious to what goes on? Neither one seems very plausible.</p>
      <p>But suppose we throw out “nature” and explain these things through inherent properties. It would still be absurd to say that the individual things in the world are inherently prone to change, and at the same time be astonished at it or complain&mdash;on the grounds that it was happening “contrary to nature.” And least of all when things return to the state from which they came. Because our elements are either simply dispersed, or are subject to a kind of gravitation&mdash;the solid portions being pulled toward earth, and what is ethereal drawn into the air, until they’re absorbed into the universal <em>logos</em>&mdash;which is subject to periodic conflagrations, or renewed through continual change.</p>
      <p>And don’t imagine either that those elements&mdash;the solid ones and the ethereal&mdash;are with us from our birth. Their influx took place yesterday, or the day before&mdash;from the food we ate, the air we breathed.</p>
      <p>And that’s what changes&mdash;not the person your mother gave birth to.</p>
      <p>&mdash;But if you’re inextricably linked to it through your sense of individuality?</p>
      <p>That’s not what we’re talking about here.</p>
      <p><a href="#book10-8" class="return">&#35;</a> <strong id="book10-8">8.</strong> Epithets for yourself: Upright. Modest. Straightforward. Sane. Cooperative. Disinterested.</p>
      <p>Try not to exchange them for others.</p>
      <p>And if you should forfeit them, set about getting them back.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that “sanity” means understanding things&mdash;each individual thing&mdash;for what they are. And not losing the thread.</p>
      <p>And “cooperation” means accepting what nature assigns you&mdash;accepting it willingly.</p>
      <p>And “disinterest” means that the intelligence should rise above the movements of the flesh&mdash;the rough and the smooth alike. Should rise above fame, above death, and everything like them.</p>
      <p>If you maintain your claim to these epithets&mdash;without caring if others apply them to you or not&mdash;you’ll become a new person, living a new life. To keep on being the person that you’ve been&mdash;to keep being mauled and degraded by the life you’re living&mdash;is to be devoid of sense and much too fond of life. Like those animal fighters at the games&mdash;torn half to pieces, covered in blood and gore, and still pleading to be held over till tomorrow &hellip; to be bitten and clawed again.</p>
      <p>Set sail, then, with this handful of epithets to guide you. And steer a steady course, if you can. Like an emigrant to the islands of the blest. And if you feel yourself adrift&mdash;as if you’ve lost control&mdash;then hope for the best, and put in somewhere where you can regain it. Or leave life altogether, not in anger, but matter-of-factly, straightforwardly, without arrogance, in the knowledge that you’ve at least done that much with your life.</p>
      <p>And as you try to keep these epithets in mind, it will help you a great deal to keep the gods in mind as well. What they want is not flattery, but for rational things to be like them. For figs to do what figs were meant to do&mdash;and dogs, and bees &hellip; and people.</p>

      <p><mark title="The Daily Stoic: April 22nd">It reaps its own harvest, unlike plants (and, in a different way, animals), whose yield is gathered in by others.</mark></p>
      <p><mark title="The Daily Stoic: April 22nd">It reaches its intended goal, no matter where the limit of its life is set.</mark> Not like dancing and theater and things like that, where the performance is incomplete if it’s broken off in the middle, but at any point&mdash;no matter which one you pick&mdash;it has fulfilled its mission, done its work completely. So that it can say, “I have what I came for.”</p>
      <p>It surveys the world and the empty space around it, and the way it’s put together. It delves into the endlessness of time to extend its grasp and comprehension of the periodic births and rebirths that the world goes through. It knows that those who come after us will see nothing different, that those who came before us saw no more than we do, and that anyone with forty years behind him and eyes in his head has seen both past and future&mdash;both alike.</p>
      <p>Also characteristic of the rational soul:</p>
      <p>Affection for its neighbors. Truthfulness. Humility. Not to place anything above itself&mdash;which is characteristic of law as well. No difference here between the <em>logos</em> of rationality and that of justice.</p>

      <p>And with everything&mdash;except virtue and what springs from it. Look at the individual parts and move from analysis to indifference.</p>
      <p>Apply this to life as a whole.</p>
      <p><a href="#book11-3" class="return">&#35;</a> <strong id="book11-3">3.</strong> The resolute soul:</p>
      <p>Resolute in separation from the body. And then in dissolution or fragmentation&mdash;or continuity.</p>
      <p>But the resolution has to be the result of its own decision, not just in response to outside forces [like the Christians]. It has to be considered and serious, persuasive to other people. Without dramatics.</p>

      <p><a href="#book11-6" class="return">&#35;</a> <strong id="book11-6">6.</strong> First, tragedies. To remind us of what can happen, and that it happens inevitably&mdash;and if something gives you pleasure on <em>that</em> stage, it shouldn’t cause you anger on this one. You realize that these are things we all have to go through, and that even those who cry aloud “o Mount Cithaeron!” have to endure them. And some excellent lines as well. These, for example:</p>
      <blockquote><p>If I and my two children cannot move the gods<br>The gods must have their reasons</p></blockquote>
      <p>Or:</p>
      <blockquote><p>And why should we feel anger at the world?</p></blockquote>
      <p>And:</p>
      <blockquote><p>To harvest life like standing stalks of grain</p></blockquote>
      <p>and a good many others.</p>
      <p>Then, after tragedy, Old Comedy: instructive in its frankness, its plain speaking designed to puncture pretensions. (<a href="#diogenes">Diogenes</a> used the same tactic for similar ends.)</p>
      <p>Then consider the Middle (and later the New) Comedy and what it aimed at&mdash;gradually degenerating into mere realism and empty technique. There are undeniably good passages, even in those writers, but what was the point of it all&mdash;the script and staging alike?</p>
      <p><a href="#book11-7" class="return">&#35;</a> <strong id="book11-7">7.</strong> It stares you in the face. No role is so well suited to philosophy as the one you happen to be in right now.</p>

      <p>The branch is cut off by someone else. But people cut themselves off&mdash;through hatred, through rejection&mdash;and don’t realize that they’re cutting themselves off from the whole civic enterprise.</p>
      <p>Except that we also have a gift, given us by <a href="#zeus">Zeus</a>, who founded this community of ours. We can reattach ourselves and become once more components of the whole.</p>
      <p>But if the rupture is too often repeated, it makes the severed part hard to reconnect, and to restore. You can see the difference between the branch that’s been there since the beginning, remaining on the tree and growing with it, and the one that’s been cut off and grafted back.</p>
      <p>“One trunk, two minds.” As the gardeners put it.</p>

Not just sound judgments, solid actions&mdash;tolerance as well, for those who try to obstruct us or give us trouble in other ways.</mark></p>
      <p><mark title="The Daily Stoic: July 17th">Because anger, too, is weakness, as much as breaking down and giving up the struggle. Both are deserters: the man who breaks and runs, and the one who lets himself be alienated from his fellow humans.</mark></p>

      <p>Hence justice. Which is the source of all the other virtues. For how could we do what justice requires if we are distracted by things that don’t matter, if we are naive, gullible, inconstant?</p>

      <p>And why is it so hard when things go against you? If it’s imposed by nature, accept it gladly and stop fighting it. And if not, work out what your own nature requires, and aim at that, even if it brings you no glory.</p>

        <li>My relationship to them. That we came into the world for the sake of one another. Or from another point of view, I came into it to be their guardian&mdash;as the ram is of the flock, and the bull of the herd.<br>Start from this: if not atoms, then Nature&mdash;directing everything. In that case, lower things for the sake of higher ones, and higher ones for one another.</li>
        <li>What they’re like eating, in bed, etc. How driven they are by their beliefs. How proud they are of what they do.</li>
        <li>That if they’re right to do this, then you have no right to complain. And if they aren’t, then they do it involuntarily, out of ignorance. Because all souls are prevented from treating others as they deserve, just as they are kept from truth: unwillingly. Which is why they resent being called unjust, or arrogant, or greedy&mdash;any suggestion that they aren’t good neighbors.</li>
        <li>That you’ve made enough mistakes yourself. You’re just like them.<br>
          Even if there are some you’ve avoided, you have the potential.<br>
        Even if cowardice has kept you from them. Or fear of what people would say. Or some equally bad reason.</li>
        <li>That you don’t know for sure it is a mistake. A lot of things are means to some other end. You have to know an awful lot before you can judge other people’s actions with real understanding.</li>
        <li>When you lose your temper, or even feel irritated: that human life is very short. Before long all of us will be laid out side by side.</li>
        <li>That it’s not what <em>they</em> do that bothers us: that’s a problem for their minds, not ours. It’s our own misperceptions. Discard them. Be willing to give up thinking of this as a catastrophe &hellip; and your anger is gone. How do you do that? By recognizing that you’ve suffered no disgrace. Unless disgrace is the only thing that can hurt you, you’re doomed to commit innumerable offenses&mdash;to become a thief, or heaven only knows what else.</li>
        <li><mark title="The Daily Stoic: June 11th">How much more damage anger and grief do than the things that cause them.</mark></li>
        <li><mark title="The Daily Stoic: May 12th">That kindness is invincible, provided it’s sincere&mdash;not ironic or an act. What can even the most vicious person do if you keep treating him with kindness and gently set him straight&mdash;if you get the chance&mdash;correcting him cheerfully at the exact moment that he’s trying to do you harm. “No, no, my friend. That isn’t what we’re here for. It isn’t me who’s harmed by that. It’s you.” And show him, gently and without pointing fingers, that it’s so.</mark> That bees don’t behave like this&mdash;or any other animals with a sense of community. Don’t do it sardonically or meanly, but affectionately&mdash;with no hatred in your heart. And not ex cathedra or to impress third parties, but speaking directly. Even if there are other people around.<br>
          Keep these nine points in mind, like gifts from the nine Muses, and start becoming a human being. Now and for the rest of your life.<br>
          And along with not getting angry at others, try not to pander either. Both are forms of selfishness; both of them will do you harm. When you start to lose your temper, remember: There’s nothing manly about rage.<br>
          It’s courtesy and kindness that define a human being&mdash;and a man. That’s who possesses strength and nerves and guts, not the angry whiners. To react like that brings you closer to impassivity&mdash;and so to strength. Pain is the opposite of strength, and so is anger. Both are things we suffer from, and yield to.<br>
        &hellip; and one more thought, from Apollo:</li>
        <li>That to expect bad people not to injure others is crazy. It’s to ask the impossible. And to let them behave like that to other people but expect them to exempt you is arrogant&mdash;the act of a tyrant.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>This thought is unnecessary.</li>
        <li>This one is destructive to the people around you.</li>
        <li>This wouldn’t be what you really think (to say what you don’t think&mdash;the definition of absurdity).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And the fourth reason for self-reproach: that the more divine part of you has been beaten and subdued by the degraded mortal part&mdash;the body and its stupid self- indulgence.</p>

But are forced to rise, and take up a position not their own. So even the elements obey the world&mdash;when ordered and compelled&mdash;and man their stations until the signal to abandon them arrives.</p>
      <p>So why should your intellect be the only dissenter&mdash;the only one complaining about its posting? It’s not as if anything is being forced on it. Only what its own nature requires. And yet it refuses to comply, and sets off in the opposite direction. Because to be drawn toward what is wrong and self-indulgent, toward anger and fear and pain, is to revolt against nature. And for the mind to complain about anything that happens is to desert its post. It was created to show reverence&mdash;respect for the divine&mdash;no less than to act justly. That too is an element of coexistence and a prerequisite for justice.</p>

Utterly vanished.</p>
      <p>Well, assuming that’s really true, you can be sure they would have arranged things differently, if that had been appropriate. If it were the right thing to do, they could have done it, and if it were natural, nature would have demanded it. So from the fact that they didn’t&mdash;if that’s the case&mdash;we can conclude that it was inappropriate.</p>
      <p>Surely you can see yourself that to ask the question is to challenge the gods’ fairness. And why would you be bringing in fairness unless the gods are, in fact, fair&mdash;and absolutely so?</p>

      <p><em>To avoid the public schools</em>: Roman aristocrats normally preferred to have their sons educated by private tutors (often specially trained household slaves) who were considered safer and more reliable than the professional schoolmasters who taught all comers for a fee.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="#book1-5">1.5</a></strong> <em>My first teacher</em>: Not named and most likely a slave.</p>
      <p><em>Not to support this side or that</em>: Literally, “not to be a Green or a Blue; not to support the <em>parmularius</em> [a gladiator with a small shield] or the <em>scutarius</em> [who carried a larger shield].”</p>
      <p><strong><a href="#book1-6">1.6</a></strong> <em>the camp-bed and the cloak</em>: Symbols of an ascetic lifestyle. Marcus’s sleeping arrangements are recorded by the <em>Historia Augusta</em>: “He used to sleep on the ground, and his mother had a hard time convincing him to sleep on a cot spread with skins.”</p>
      <p><strong><a href="#book1-7">1.7</a></strong> <em>his own copy</em>: It is unclear whether this refers to <a href="https://vreeman.com/discourses/">Arrian’s <em>Discourses of Epictetus</em></a> or to a set of unpublished notes, perhaps taken by <a href="#rusticus">Rusticus</a> himself.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="#book1-13">1.13</a></strong> <em>Domitius and Athenodotus</em>: The anecdote Marcus refers to is unknown.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="#book1-14">1.14</a></strong> <em>My brother</em>: Probably a copyist’s error based on confusion between the names Verus and Severus.</p>
      <p><em><a href="#thrasea">Thrasea</a>, <a href="#helvidius">Helvidius</a>, <a href="#cato1">Cato</a></em>: For the significance of these three figures as Stoic exemplars see the <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a>.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="#book1-16">1.16</a></strong> <em>My adopted father</em>: <a href="#antoninus">Antoninus Pius</a>. The sketch here seems to be a development and expansion of the briefer assessment in <a href="#book6-30">6.30</a>.</p>
      <p><em>Putting a stop to the pursuit of boys</em>: This may be meant as a critique of Antoninus’s predecessor, <a href="#hadrian2">Hadrian (2)</a>, whose love affair with the youth Antinoüs was notorious. Alternatively it might refer to legal restrictions on pederasty (which was common in upper-class Greek and Roman society), or to Antoninus’s own self-restraint.</p>
      <p><em>The robe &hellip; the customs agent’s apology</em>: These examples of Antoninus’s modesty are too compressed and allusive to be intelligible to anyone but Marcus himself.</p>
      <p><em>as they say of Socrates</em>: Marcus may be recalling a similar comment by <a href="#xenophon">Xenophon</a>, <em>Memorabilia</em> 1.3.14; <a href="#socrates">Socrates’</a> ability to drink heavily without any apparent effect is celebrated in <a href="#plato">Plato’s</a> <em>Symposium</em> (179c, 220a).</p>
      <p><em>Maximus’s illness</em>: For <a href="#maximus">Maximus</a> see the <a href="#persons">Index of Persons</a>; nothing is known of his illness.</p>

      <p><em>the kind of brother</em>: <a href="#verus3">Verus (3)</a>.</p>
      <p><em>the honors they seemed to want</em>: Marcus may be thinking of Herodes Atticus and <a href="#fronto">Fronto</a>, both of whom held consulships in 143, soon after Marcus became the heir apparent. Perhaps also of <a href="#rusticus">Rusticus</a>, who held a second consulship in 162.</p>
      <p><em>I never laid a finger</em>: Household slaves were often exposed to sexual abuse at the hands of their owners.</p>
      <p><em>That I have the wife I do</em>: <a href="#faustina">Faustina</a>.</p>
      <p><em>at Caieta</em>: A seaport on the west coast of Italy. The Greek text adds an unintelligible phrase, which some scholars interpret as a reference to “an oracle.”</p>
      <p><em>“we need the help &hellip;”</em>: Apparently a quotation, but not from any surviving work.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="#book2">2.</a></strong> <em>On the River Gran, Among the Quadi</em>: The notation is transmitted at the end of <a href="#book1">Book 1</a>, but is more likely to belong here. The Gran (or Hron) is a tributary of the Danube flowing through modern-day Slovakia. The Quadi were a Suebian tribe in the Morava River valley, subdued during the Marcomannic Wars of the early 170s.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="#book2-2">2.2</a></strong> <em>Throw away &hellip; right now</em>: These words are deleted or transposed elsewhere by some editors.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="#book2-10">2.10</a></strong> <em>the ones committed out of desire are worse</em>: Strictly speaking, this assessment is in conflict with Stoic doctrine, which holds that there are no degrees of wrongness; all wrong actions are equally wrong and it makes no sense to speak of one as being “worse” than another.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="#book2-13">2.13</a></strong> <em>“delving into &hellip;”</em>: A line from the lyric poet Pindar (frg. 282), quoted also by <a href="#plato">Plato</a>, <em>Theaetetus</em> 173e.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="#book3">3.</a></strong> <em>In Carnuntum</em>: Transmitted at the end of <a href="#book2">Book 2</a>, but probably meant to head <a href="#book3">Book 3</a>. Carnuntum was a fortress on the Danube which housed the Legio XIV Gemina and served as the seat of the governor of Upper Pannonia. Marcus is known to have been in the area in 172 and 173.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="#book3-3">3.3</a></strong> <em>Chaldaeans</em>: The Chaldaeans (Babylonians) had a special reputation as astrologers.</p>
      <p><em><a href="#democritus">Democritus</a></em>: Apparently an error for another pre-Socratic philosopher, Pherecydes, who was said to have been eaten by worms. (Democritus’s name was often coupled with that of <a href="#heraclitus">Heraclitus</a>, which may explain Marcus’s slip here.)</p>
      <p><em>Socrates</em>: The “vermin” who killed <a href="#socrates">Socrates</a> are the Athenians who prosecuted and condemned him.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="#book3-6">3.6</a></strong> <em>as <a href="#socrates">Socrates</a> used to say</em>: It is not clear whether Marcus is alluding to a specific passage (perhaps <a href="#plato">Plato</a>, <em>Phaedo</em> 83a–b) or merely to a general impression of Socratic doctrine.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="#book3-14">3.14</a></strong> <em>your Brief Comments</em>: Evidently collections of anecdotes and/or quotations put together by Marcus himself for his own use, like parts of the extant <em>Meditations</em>.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="#book3-15">3.15</a></strong> <em>They don’t realize &hellip; </em>: The significance of this entry (particularly the last phrase) is unclear.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="#book3-16">3.16</a></strong> <em>people who do &lt; &hellip; &gt;</em>: It seems clear that something is missing from the text, perhaps deliberately omitted by a prudish copyist.</p>

Marcus apparently sees the observation as compatible with the Stoic doctrine that “it’s all in how you perceive it” (<a href="#book12-8">12.8</a>), though he naturally rejects the subsequent reference to atoms.

      <p><strong><a href="#book8-38">8.38</a></strong> <em>Look at it clearly</em>: The text, meaning and articulation of entries 38 and 39 are very uncertain. Earlier editors printed the opening of 38 as the end of 37, and took the phrases “Look at it clearly&mdash;if you can” and “To the best of my judgment” as a single unit, though the resulting sentence yields no coherent sense. I follow J. Dalfen in separating them.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="#book8-39">8.39</a></strong> <em>“To the best of my judgment &hellip;”</em>: I have placed the entry in quotation marks on the basis of the opening phrase, which includes a parenthetical “he [or “someone”] says.” This assumes that the phrase is correctly transmitted (it is certainly not easy to construe), and that it should be taken with what follows rather than what precedes, which is far from certain (see previous note). However, the entry as a whole (an implicit criticism of the Epicureans’ view of pleasure as the supreme good) does not strike me as being typical of Marcus’s style, and I suspect he may indeed be quoting some earlier writer.</p>

His influence on <a href="#marcus-aurelius-antoninus">Marcus</a> is attested by the <em>Historia Augusta</em>, although the reference to him in <a href="#book1-17">1.17</a> suggests that their relationship had its ups and downs.

        <dd>Either Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus (c. 235–183 <abbr title="before Christ">B.C.</abbr>), who defeated Hannibal in the Second Punic War, or his grandson by adoption, Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus (185/4–129 <abbr title="before Christ">B.C.</abbr>), the conqueror of Carthage in the Third Punic War.

        <dt id="severus2">Severus (2)</dt>
        <dd>Gnaeus Claudius Severus Arabianus from Pompeiopolis in Asia Minor, consul in 146; his son (perhaps the Severus of <a href="#book10-31">10.31</a>) married one of Marcus’s daughters. He was an adherent of the Peripatetic school, which traced its heritage back to Aristotle. (<a href="#book1-14">1.14</a>)</dd>

        <dd>Sextus of Chaeronea, Stoic philosopher, teacher of both <a href="#marcus-aurelius-antoninus">Marcus</a> and <a href="#verus3">Lucius Verus</a>, and nephew of the great biographer and antiquarian Plutarch. (<a href="#book1-9">1.9</a>)</dd>

        <dt id="socrates">Socrates</dt>
        <dd>Athenian philosopher (469–399 <abbr title="before Christ">B.C.</abbr>), teacher of <a href="#plato">Plato</a>. He spent most of his life in his native city, and served with distinction in the Peloponnesian War against Sparta. Although associated with several members of the aristocratic junta that ruled Athens after its defeat in 404, he refused to participate in their atrocities. He was executed by the Athenians on a charge of impiety following the restoration of democracy; Plato’s <em>Apology</em> purports to give his speech at the trial.

        <dt id="socraticus">Socraticus</dt>
        <dd>Unknown; the comparison with <a href="#satyron">Satyron</a> does not help identify him. (<a href="#book10-31">10.31</a>)</dd>
        <dt id="stertinius">Stertinius</dt>
        <dd>Not certainly identified. Tacitus mentions an army officer of this name in the reign of Tiberius. But the reference to Baiae (a Roman resort on the Bay of Naples) suggests a more likely candidate a generation or so later: the wealthy Neapolitan physician Quintus Stertinius, mentioned by Pliny the Elder (<em>Natural History</em> 29.7). (<a href="#book12-27">12.27</a>)</dd>
        <dt id="tandasis">Tandasis</dt>
        <dd>Philosopher mentioned along with one <a href="#marcianus">Marcianus</a>; neither is otherwise known. Some have suggested a scribe’s error for Basilides, listed among Marcus’s teachers by other sources. (<a href="#book1-6">1.6</a>)</dd>
        <dt id="telauges">Telauges</dt>
        <dd>Apparently a lesser disciple of <a href="#socrates">Socrates</a>, unless the reference is to the son of <a href="#pythagoras">Pythagoras</a> by this name. (<a href="#book7-66">7.66</a>)</dd>
        <dt id="theodotus">Theodotus</dt>

        <dt id="thrasea">Thrasea</dt>
        <dd>Publius Clodius Thrasea Paetus (d. 66), Roman aristocrat (consul 56) and father-in-law of <a href="#helvidius">Helvidius</a> Priscus. His opposition to the regime of <a href="#nero">Nero</a> (by whom he was eventually forced to commit suicide) was informed by Stoic philosophy and in particular by the example of the younger <a href="#cato2">Cato (2)</a>, of whom he wrote a biography. (<a href="#book1-14">1.14</a>)</dd>
        <dt id="tiberius">Tiberius</dt>
        <dd>Roman emperor (14–37) who succeeded <a href="#augustus">Augustus</a>. Late in his reign he withdrew to a private estate on the island of Capri; his alleged excesses there are recorded in the biography of him by Suetonius. (<a href="#book12-27">12.27</a>)</dd>

        <dt id="verus1">Verus (1)</dt>
        <dd>Marcus Annius Verus (d. 138), grandfather of <a href="#marcus-aurelius-antoninus">Marcus</a>. He was three times consul (the last two in 121 and 126); he also served as city prefect of Rome about this time. After the death of his wife he evidently took a concubine who helped raise Marcus. (<a href="#book1-1">1.1</a>, <a href="#book1-17">1.17</a>, <a href="#book9-21">9.21</a>)</dd>
        <dt id="verus2">Verus (2)</dt>
        <dd>Marcus Annius Verus, father of <a href="#marcus-aurelius-antoninus">Marcus</a> and husband of <a href="#lucilla">Lucilla</a>. He died sometime between 130 and 135. (<a href="#book1-2">1.2</a>, <a href="#book8-25">8.25</a>)</dd>
        <dt id="verus3">Verus (3)</dt>
        <dd>Lucius Aurelius Verus (130–169), son of <a href="#hadrian2">Hadrian (2)’s</a> intended successor, Lucius Aelius. Originally named Lucius Ceionius Commodus, he was adopted along with <a href="#marcus-aurelius-antoninus">Marcus</a> by <a href="#antoninus">Antoninus Pius</a> and on Antoninus’s death became co-emperor with Marcus. He was entrusted with the conduct of the Parthian War, and campaigned with Marcus on the northern frontier before his sudden death on the way back to Rome. (<a href="#book1-17">1.17</a>, <a href="#book8-37">8.37</a>)</dd>
        <dt id="vespasian">Vespasian</dt>
        <dd>Roman emperor (69–79). His reign represented a period of stability after the power struggle that followed the death of <a href="#nero">Nero</a>, but he came into conflict with some members of the senatorial class, notably the Stoic <a href="#helvidius">Helvidius Priscus</a>. (<a href="#book4-32">4.32</a>)</dd>
        <dt id="volesus">Volesus</dt>
        <dd>Traditional surname in the Valerius clan, which produced a number of figures prominent in early historical accounts. Which one Marcus has in mind is uncertain. (<a href="#book4-33">4.33</a>)</dd>
        <dt id="xanthippe">Xanthippe</dt>
        <dd>Wife of <a href="#socrates">Socrates</a> and proverbially a shrew. (<a href="#book11-28">11.28</a>)</dd>

        <dt id="zeus">Zeus</dt>
        <dd>Sky god and head of the Greek pantheon; Marcus refers to him only rarely and normally prefers a vaguer formulation such as “God” or “the gods.” (<a href="#book4-23">4.23</a>, <a href="#book5-7">5.7</a>, <a href="#book5-8">5.8</a>, <a href="#book11-8">11.8</a>)</dd>
