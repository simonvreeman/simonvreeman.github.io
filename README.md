## Privacy Policy
I use Google Analytics to measure, track and analyse user behaviour on vreeman.com and it is loaded via Google Tag Manager. 

If you want to opt-out use the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)

Vreeman.com is hosted on Github. jQuery, Bootstrap & Font Awesome is loaded via the jsdelivr.net. They will both probably track some data too.

## Cookies
Google Analytics will place one cookie with a unique user ID. 

Irregularly I will A/B test some stuff on vreeman.com and I use cookies for that too. I don't use an A/B testing tool. Just my own script that is loaded via Google Tag Manager.
