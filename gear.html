      <h1>Travel Gear</h1>
      <p>An unsorted list of travel gear I pack in my backpack. Inspired by Matt Mullenweg's "<a href="https://ma.tt/2018/10/whats-in-my-bag-2018-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What's in my bag</a>" post, <a href="http://omakas.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polle de Maagt's travel notebook</a>.</p>
      <p>I like to travel with only the minimal essentials. Everything that I'm not using regularly, I simply don't want to take it with me. IMHO there is no need to pack your backpack for all the possible "What if" moments. Here are <a href="https://www.carryology.com/travel/23-reasons-why-you-should-try-one-bag-travel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">23 other reasons</a> why you should travel with just one carry-on backpack.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2 id="backpacks">My preferred backpacks</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Goruck Echo (Discontinued)</dt>
        <dd>My 16L daily <abbr title="Everyday carry">EDC</abbr> backpack that I use for commuting to work when I only carry essentials. And still some space available for an extra jacket or some groceries.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr1"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goruck GR1</a></dt>
        <dd>This is my other daily <abbr title="Everyday carry">EDC</abbr> backpack that I use when going to the gym before or after work. It always contains the same  <abbr title="Everyday carry">EDC</abbr> gear as the Echo, plus the extra gym gear that I need for the day. It has a volume of 26L. This daypack is also big enough for a weekend or midweek away.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goruck GR2</a></dt>
        <dd>The GR2 is great for longer trips. I used it to travel around Japan for 3 weeks, and Mexico for 2 weeks. And the best thing is, it is still a TSA carry-on compliant 40L backpack, so a great travel backpack.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>For me, the pro's of the Goruck backpacks is first of all the aesthetics. It has a low profile, it is not obvious that you are a backpacker or tourist and thus carry value stuff. Plus it looks good when traveling for work. The bag opens flat, this makes (un)packing so much easier. It has a separate compartment for my laptop, which you can easily access, but still safe because it is hidden and closest to your back.</p>
      <p>A big con is definitely the steep price. (Be patient and wait for a discount moment like 4th of July, Veterans Day or Black Friday). But I also think it will pay itself back because of the robust build of the bag. It feels like it will last a lifetime. Another thing is the outside front pocket. It is not very accessible when your bag is full with your belongings. Unfortunately it is not really a quick access pocket. For that purpose, I use the one small pocket inside the bag. And the front pocket to put away small flat items and I irregularly need.</p>

        <dt><a href="https://www.goruck.com/collections/accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goruck Field Pocket GR1</a></dt>
        <dd>3L field pocket that carries all sorts of small <abbr title="Everyday carry">EDC</abbr> and valuable items. Like all the Apple adapters, cables and power plugs. I also have the Echo and GR2 field pockets that I can use if I'm packing more or less.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://seatosummit.com/product/see-pouch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sea to Summit See Pouch (medium)</a></dt>
        <dd>Handy and light 2L dopp kit for my toiletries. Because you can see through it, makes it very easy to go through security at an airport when traveling with only carry-on.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.ikea.com/nl/nl/catalog/products/90328178/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ikea packing cubes</a></dt>
        <dd>The field pockets by Goruck are great for holding <abbr title="Everyday carry">EDC</abbr> or valuable items. So I was still on the lookout for lighter and slightly larger packing cubes for my clothing. For now, I'm going for the packing cubes by Ikea. Simply because they are cheap. Put some cedar wood chips in them to keep your clothing fresh. I do have my eye on the packing cubes of <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/products/packing-cube" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peak Design</a>, because you can compress them.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.goruck.com/the-american-waterproof-jacket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goruck American Waterproof Jacket</a></dt>
        <dd>A super straightforward jacket to block wind and water. It has enough big pockets to put a lot of stuff in.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-nano-puff-jacket/84212.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patagonia Nano Puff</a></dt>
        <dd>Warm lightweigt jacket that can be warn underneath my wind and water jacket. Together they make an excellent winter jacket. And it is very packable so it doesn't take up a lot of space in my backpack.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple MacBook Pro 13”</a></dt>

        <dd>Handy kit with all the adapters that you may need. They work for the laptop and iPad charger. I always take an iPad charger and cable with me for charging my iPhone. And only the adapters that I need to take for the specific trip.</dd>
        <dt>Apple Keyboard & Mouse</dt>
        <dd>Both are small and lightweight. Ideal for traveling.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.therooststand.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roost laptop stand</a></dt>
        <dd>A laptop stand that can raise you laptop to the ideal hight for you back and neck. Making remote working just as good as working from the office. It is super lightweight and packs super small, so it fits easily in that small spot somewhare in my Goruck.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWP22AM/A/airpods-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple AirPods Pro</a></dt>

        <dt><a href="https://dopper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dopper water bottle</a></dt>
        <dd>Stay hydrated. Drink water. Alcohol doesn't count. Reduce plastic waste. But make sure it's empty before you go through security at the airport. Fill it up after security for free and you will easily save €5,- every trip.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.secrid.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secrid wallet</a></dt>

      <h2>My favorite apps when traveling</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Google Maps</dt>
        <dd>IMHO the best app to find my way around in a city, because it now also include public transport information.</dd>
        <dt>Foursquare &amp; Swarm</dt>
        <dd>To find hidden local gems, and keep a logbook of all the places I've been.</dd>
        <dt>Google Translate</dt>
        <dd>Before I go on a trip I download the local language in the app. Live translations to English by the camera even worked for Japanese.</dd>
        <dt>Uber</dt>
        <dd>Get around a city quickly. Especially handy for traveling to and from an airport. When I'm tired or a bit stressful because of catching my flights. I don't want to deal with obnoxious cab drivers, and even negotiate about prices.</dd>
        <dt>Reisapp Buitenlandse Zaken</dt>
        <dd>The app from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs that provides information around travel advise, safety and contact details for each country. Always handy if you get in to an emergency situation.</dd>
        <dt>Spotify</dt>
        <dd>For podcasts and my favorite music playlists (already downloaded at home!) to lift me up when feeling down or to get to sleep in the airplane.</dd>
        <dt>Things</dt>
        <dd>Simply the best to-do list app for iOS an Mac.</dd>
